Able to launch payloads heavier than 8,000 kg (18,000 lb) into low Earth orbit, Antares is currently the largest rocket operated by Northrop Grumman. Antares launches from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport and made its inaugural flight on April 21, 2013. NASA awarded Orbital a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Space Act Agreement (SAA) in 2008 to demonstrate delivery of cargo to the International Space Station. For these COTS missions Orbital intends to use Antares to launch its Cygnus spacecraft. In addition, Antares will compete for small-to-medium missions. Originally designated the Taurus II, Orbital Sciences renamed the vehicle Antares, after the star of the same name, on December 12, 2011. Out of 17 total launches, Antares has suffered one failure. During the fifth launch on October 28, 2014, the rocket failed catastrophically, and the vehicle and payload were destroyed. The rocket's first-stage engines were identified as the cause for the failure. A different engine was chosen for subsequent launches, and the rocket had a successful return to flight on October 17, 2016. The Antares has flown two major design iterations, the 100 series and 200 series. Both series have used a Castor 30XL as an upper stage but have differed on the first stage. The 100 series used two Kerolox powered AJ26 engine in the first stage and launched successfully four times. The 100 series was retired following a launch failure in 2014. The 200 series which first flew in 2016 also featured a Kerolox first stage but instead used two RD-181 engine along with other minor upgrades. The 200 series future became uncertain following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Due to the first stage being produced in Ukraine and the engines in Russia, future production of the rocket was unable to be continued. As a result Northrop Grumman entered into an agreement with Firefly Aerospace to build the first stage of the Antares 300 series. Northrop also contracted with SpaceX for 3 Falcon 9 launches.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cropped_NG-11_Launch.jpg?width=300" alt="Antares (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(rocket)">Aquarius (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 10.0</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 4.0</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 43.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Cancelled</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Hawaii</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Aquarius is a launch vehicle concept designed for low-cost by Space Systems/Loral to carry small, inexpensive payloads into LEO.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Aquarius_rocket.png?width=300" alt="Aquarius (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_I">Ares I</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 5.5</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 94.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Cancelled as of October 2010</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Kennedy Space Center, LC-39B</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Ares I was the crew launch vehicle that was being developed by NASA as part of the Constellation program.

Ares I was to complement the larger, uncrewed Ares V, which was the cargo launch vehicle for Constellation. NASA selected the Ares designs for their anticipated overall safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness. However, the Constellation program, including Ares I, was cancelled by U.S. president Barack Obama in October 2010 with the passage of his 2010 NASA authorization bill. In September 2011, NASA detailed the Space Launch System as its new vehicle for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Ares_I_launch.jpg?width=300" alt="Ares I"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_V">Ares V</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 3700.0</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 10.0</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 116.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Canceled as of October 2010</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Ares V (formerly known as the Cargo Launch Vehicle or CaLV) was the planned cargo launch component of the cancelled NASA Constellation program, which was to have replaced the Space Shuttle after its retirement in 2011. Ares V was also planned to carry supplies for a human presence on Mars. Ares V and the smaller Ares I were named after Ares, the Greek god of war. The Ares V was to launch the Earth Departure Stage and Altair lunar lander for NASA's return to the Moon, which was planned for 2019. It would also have served as the principal launcher for missions beyond the Earth-Moon system, including the program's ultimate goal, a crewed mission to Mars. The uncrewed Ares V would complement the smaller, and human-rated Ares I rocket for the launching of the 4–6 person Orion spacecraft. Both rockets, deemed safer than the then-current Space Shuttle, would have employed technologies developed for the Apollo program, the Shuttle program, and the Delta IV EELV program. However, the Constellation program, including Ares V and Ares I, was canceled in October 2010 by the NASA Authorization Act of 2010. In September 2011, NASA detailed the Space Launch System as its new vehicle for human exploration beyond Earth's orbit, while commercial space companies would provide low earth orbit access for both cargo and astronauts.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Ares-V_(Feb_2008).jpg?width=300" alt="Ares V"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_1">Ariane 1</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1979-12-24</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1986-02-22</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> ELA-1, Guiana Space Centre</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Ariane 1 was the first rocket in the Ariane family of expendable launch systems. It was developed and operated by the European Space Agency (ESA), which had been formed in 1973, the same year that development of the launcher had commenced. Ariane 1 was the first launcher to be developed with the primary purpose of sending commercial satellites into geosynchronous orbit. Crucially, it was designed with the ability of sending a pair of satellites into orbit on a single launcher, thus reducing costs. As the size of satellites grew, Ariane 1 quickly gave way to the more powerful Ariane 2 and Ariane 3 launchers, which were heavily based upon the original rocket. The Ariane 4 was the last rocket to heavily draw upon the Ariane 1, as the successor rocket Ariane 5 uses a far greater proportion of all-new elements.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Ariane_1_Le_Bourget_FRA_001.jpg?width=300" alt="Ariane 1"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_4">Ariane 4</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> ELA-2, Kourou</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Ariane 4 was a European expendable space launch system, developed by the Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES), the French space agency, for the European Space Agency (ESA). It was manufactured by ArianeGroup and marketed by Arianespace. Since its first flight on 15 June 1988 until the final flight on 15 February 2003, it attained 113 successful launches out of 116 total launches. In 1982, the Ariane 4 program was approved by ESA. Drawing heavily upon the preceding Ariane 3, it was designed to provide a launcher capable of delivering heavier payloads and at a lower cost per kilogram than the earlier members of the Ariane family. The Ariane 4 was principally an evolution of the existing technologies used, as opposed to being revolutionary in its design ethos; this approach quickly gained the backing of most ESA members, who funded and participated in its development and operation. Capable of being equipped with a wide variety of strap-on boosters, the Ariane 4 gained a reputation for being an extremely versatile launcher. Once in service, the launcher soon became recognized for being ideal for launching communications and Earth observation satellites, as well as those used for scientific research. During its working life, the Ariane 4 managed to capture 50% of the market in launching commercial satellites, soundly demonstrating Europe's ability to compete in the commercial launch sector. In February 2003, the final Ariane 4 was launched; Arianespace had decided to retire the type in favour of the newer and larger Ariane 5, which effectively replaced it in service.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Ariane42P_rocket.png?width=300" alt="Ariane 4"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5">Ariane 5</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> €139–185 million</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1996-06-04</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2003-09-27</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> ECA: Active</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> ELA-3, Guiana Space Centre</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Ariane 5 is a European heavy-lift space launch vehicle developed and operated by Arianespace for the European Space Agency (ESA). It is launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) in French Guiana. It has been used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth orbit (LEO). The launch vehicle had a streak of 82 consecutive successful launches between 9 April 2003 and 12 December 2017. Since 2014, Ariane 6, a direct successor system, is in development. The system was designed as an expendable launch system by the Centre national d'études spatiales (CNES), the French government's space agency, in cooperation with various European partners. Despite not being a direct derivative of its predecessor launch vehicle program, it is classified as part of the Ariane rocket family. ArianeGroup is the prime contractor for the manufacturing of the vehicles, leading a multi-country consortium of other European contractors. Ariane 5 was originally intended to launch the Hermes spacecraft, and thus it is rated for human space launches. Since its first launch, Ariane 5 has been refined in successive versions: "G", "G+", "GS", "ECA", and most recently, "ES". The system has a commonly used dual-launch capability, where up to two large geostationary belt communication satellites can be mounted using a SYLDA (Système de Lancement Double Ariane, meaning "Ariane Double-Launch System") carrier system. Up to three, somewhat smaller, main satellites are possible depending on size using a SPELTRA (Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement Triple Ariane, which translates to "Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure"). Up to eight secondary payloads, usually small experiment packages or minisatellites, can be carried with an ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads) platform. Following the launch of 15 August 2020, Arianespace signed the contracts for the last eight Ariane 5 launches, before it is succeeded by the new Ariane 6 launcher, according to Daniel Neuenschwander, director of space transportation at the ESA.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Ariane_5_with_James_Webb_Space_Telescope_Prelaunch_(51773093465).jpg?width=300" alt="Ariane 5"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_6">Ariane 6</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> 1.15E8</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> In Development</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Guiana Space Centre</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Ariane 6 is a European expendable launch system currently under development since the early 2010s by ArianeGroup on behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA). It is intended to replace the Ariane 5, as part of the Ariane launch vehicle family. The stated motivation for Ariane 6 (as of 2015) was to halve the cost compared to Ariane 5, and increase the capacity for the number of launches per year (from six or seven to up to eleven). Ariane 6 is designed with two core stages both powered by liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen (hydrolox) engines. The first stage has an improved version of the Vulcain engine already used on the Ariane 5, whilst the second stage has a newly designed Vinci engine. Most of the initial lift-off thrust is provided by solid rocket boosters attached to the first stage: either two or four P120s (Ariane 62 and Ariane 64 variants respectively), which are larger versions of the P80s used on the Vega rocket. Selection of the design concept was made by ESA in December 2014, favouring it over an alternative all-solid-fuel rocket option. Further high-level design was completed in 2015 and the vehicle entered the detailed design phase in 2016. In 2017, the European Space Agency (ESA) set 16 July 2020 as the deadline for the first flight, and in May 2019 Arianespace placed the first production order. Following several delays, as of October 2022 Arianespace expects the first launch to occur in the fourth quarter of 2023.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Ariane6_logo.svg?width=300" alt="Ariane 6"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena_I">Athena I</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 66.3</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 2.36</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 18.9</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2021-09-03</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2016-01-17</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> CCAFS, Kodiak Launch Complex, Vandenberg AFB</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Athena I, known as the Lockheed Launch Vehicle (LLV) at the time of its first flight and Lockheed Martin Launch Vehicle (LMLV) at the time of its second flight, was an American small expendable launch system which was used for four launches between 1995 and 2001. It is a member of the Athena family of rockets, along with the larger Athena II. The Athena I is a three-stage rocket, consisting of solid first and second stages, and a monopropellant liquid-fuelled third stage. The first stage is a Castor 120, which is also used on some versions of the Taurus rocket. An motor was used as the second stage on launches up to 2001. The third stage is an , fuelled by hydrazine and propelled by four engines, which is used for final insertion. Prior to its retirement in 2001, Athena I launches were made from Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Launch Complex 46 at Spaceport Florida, and of the Kodiak Launch Complex. Four Athena I launches have been conducted, with one failure. Its maiden flight was conducted from SLC-6 at Vandenberg, and lifted off at 22:30 UTC on 15 August 1995. It was intended to place into orbit, however the rocket was destroyed by the range safety officer after the failure of its thrust vectoring system resulted in a loss of control. The launch was the first from SLC-6, which had originally been built for the Titan III rocket for launches of the Manned Orbital Laboratory, and was later rebuilt for polar orbit Space Shuttle launches. Both MOL and polar Shuttle flights were cancelled before any launches were made from SLC-6.The next Athena I launch was on 23 August 1997, and successfully placed the Lewis satellite into orbit for NASA. This launch also took place from SLC-6 at Vandenberg. The third Athena I launch was from LC-46 at Spaceport Florida, and took place on 27 January 1999.

It is a member of the Athena family of rockets, along with the smaller Athena I. The Athena II is a four-stage rocket, consisting of solid first, second and third stages, and a monopropellant liquid-fueled fourth stage. The first and second stages are Castor 120s, which are also used on some versions of the Taurus rocket. An motor was used as the third stage on launches during the 1990s. A planned second generation Athena II launch vehicle will use a Castor 30 third stage which is under currently under development for the Taurus II. The fourth stage is an , fueled by hydrazine and propelled by four engines, which is used for final insertion. Prior to its retirement in 1999, Athena II launches were made from Launch Complex 46 at Spaceport Florida and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. LC-46 will also be used for Athena IIc launches, with Launch Pad 0B of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport and of the Kodiak Launch Complex also offered. During the 1990s, three Athena II launches were conducted, with one failure. Its maiden flight was conducted from LC-46 at Spaceport Florida, and lifted off at 02:28 GMT on 7 January 1997. The launch, which was the first to take place from Spaceport Florida, successfully placed the Lunar Prospector spacecraft into orbit for NASA. The next Athena II launch took place from SLC-6 at Vandenberg on 27 April 1999, with the Ikonos satellite for Space Imaging. The launch ended in failure after the payload fairing failed to separate, and as a result the rocket had too much mass to achieve orbital velocity. The third launch also took place from SLC-6 at Vandenberg, on 24 September 1999. The payload, Ikonos 1, was also for Space Imaging, and successfully reached orbit.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Athena_2_-_Lunar_Prospector.jpg?width=300" alt="Athena II"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_E/F">Atlas E/F</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 9</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1965-08-04</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2001-03-24</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Vandenberg Air Force Base, Vandenberg Launch Complex 576, Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 3</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Atlas E/F (or SB-1A) was an American expendable launch system and sounding rocket built using parts of decommissioned SM-65 Atlas missiles.

It was a member of the Atlas family of rockets, and was used to launch seven communication satellites during the mid to late 1980s. Atlas G consisted of an improved Atlas core with modernized avionics and stretched propellant tanks. The Centaur stage also had several updated components and other technical improvements. It was replaced by the Atlas I, which had an improved guidance system. The maiden voyage of Atlas G was the launch of Intelsat 5 on June 9, 1984. Atlas performance was normal as was Centaur orbital injection, but during the coasting phase prior to the second Centaur burn, the stage's LOX tank split open. The Centaur and Intelsat tumbled end-over-end and were left in a useless orbit where they remained until reentering the atmosphere four months later. Investigation into the failure found that a minor fatigue crack developed in the Centaur LOX tank during staging and orbital injection, which eventually led to complete tank failure and loss of the mission. The uprated Centaur flown on Atlas G, among other changes, deleted the propellant boost pumps in the interest of greater simplicity and weight-saving. To compensate for this, LOX tank pressure was increased 25%. Although the tank had been designed to accommodate higher pressure, technicians at Convair inexplicably failed to test Centaur 5402 for leaks before shipping it to Cape Canaveral. In addition, engineers had not tested the Centaur G stages to verify if they could handle the shock from the explosive bolts on the booster firing during staging, but this test was performed later and the stage passed it. Finally, the leak testing program and tools used at Convair were outdated and less reliable than newer methods and the tech personnel in charge of fabricating the Centaur's balloon tanks were badly inexperienced. Ultimately, this was a symptom of the entire US space program in the 1980s as plans to entirely replace expendable launch vehicles with the Space Shuttle had resulted in large-scale budget cutbacks and layoffs of experienced technicians. The first stage was derived from the SM-65 Atlas missile, and a Centaur was used as the second stage. The first stage was also flown without the Centaur, as the Atlas H.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Atlas-G.jpg?width=300" alt="Atlas G"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_H">Atlas H</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1983-02-09</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1987-05-15</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3, Vandenberg Air Force Base</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Atlas H was an American expendable launch system derived from the SM-65 Atlas missile.

It was a member of the Atlas family of rockets, and was launched 109 times between 1960 and 1978. It was used to launch the first five Mariner uncrewed probes to the planets Venus and Mars, and the Ranger and Lunar Orbiter uncrewed probes to the Moon. The upper stage was also used as an uncrewed orbital target vehicle for the Gemini crewed spacecraft to practice rendezvous and docking. However, the launch vehicle family was originally developed for the Air Force and most of its launches were classified DoD payloads. The Atlas-Agena was a two-and-a-half-stage rocket, with a stage-and-a-half Atlas missile as the first stage, and an RM-81 Agena second stage. Initially, Atlas D missiles, redesignated as the LV-3, were used as the first stage. These were later replaced by the standardized Atlas SLV-3, and its derivatives, the SLV-3A and B. The final Atlas-Agena launch used an Atlas E/F. The earliest Agena variant was the Agena A in 1959–60, which did not have restart capability. Most of these were flown on Thor-Agena boosters for the Discoverer program and only four used Atlases (Midas 1, Midas 2, Samos 1, and Samos 2), two of which failed. Late in 1960, Lockheed introduced the uprated Agena B stage which was restartable and had longer propellant tanks for more burn time. It first flew on the Thor and did not make its maiden voyage on an Atlas for months, when Midas 3 launched on July 12, 1961. Atlas-Agenas were then used for DoD and NASA programs, but proved a reliability nightmare as one failure after another happened. In late 1962, after Ranger 5 suffered another booster malfunction, albeit a minor one that ground controllers were able to work around, NASA convened a review board which undertook a wholesale reevaluation of the Atlas-Agena as a launch vehicle. The board found that quality control and checkout procedures were poor, and that this situation was exacerbated by the several dozen configurations of the booster, as each individual DoD and NASA program necessitated custom modifications to the Atlas and Agena, and the latter also differed in its Atlas and Thor variants. The board recommended improved quality control, better hardware, and also establishing one standardized launch vehicle for all space programs. The end result was the Atlas SLV-3 and Agena D, standardized versions of the Atlas D core and Agena B which would be the same on every launch (at least as far as the Atlas was concerned, Agena Ds often still had customized setups, especially for DoD payloads). The Agena D first flew in July 1963 for DoD launches, but NASA continued using Agena Bs for the remaining Ranger missions. The Atlas SLV-3 meanwhile first flew in August 1964. Dozens of Atlas SLV-3/Agena D boosters were flown over the following years, mostly for the KH-7 Gambit program, also for a few NASA missions. The last Atlas-Agena was flown in 1978 to launch SEASAT, but on a repurposed Atlas F missile rather than the SLV-3. Launches were conducted from Launch Complexes 12, 13 and 14 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Launch Complexes 1 and 2 at Point Arguello (now SLC-3 and 4 at Vandenberg Air Force Base).</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Atlas_Agena_launching_Lunar_Orbiter_4.jpg?width=300" alt="Atlas-Agena"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas-Centaur">Atlas-Centaur</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 13</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1962-05-08</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2004-08-31</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 36, Cape Canaveral Space Force Station</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Atlas-Centaur was a United States expendable launch vehicle derived from the SM-65 Atlas D missile.

The payloads of ASLV were Stretched Rohini Satellites.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/ASLV_Launch.jpeg?width=300" alt="Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Arrow">Black Arrow</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 18.13</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 2.0</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 13.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2004-11-08</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2018-09-15</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Woomera Prohibited Area</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Black Arrow, officially capitalised BLACK ARROW, was a British satellite carrier rocket. Developed during the 1960s, it was used for four launches between 1969 and 1971, all launched from the Woomera Prohibited Area in Australia. Its final flight was the first and only successful orbital launch to be conducted by the United Kingdom, and placed the Prospero satellite into low Earth orbit. Black Arrow originated from studies by the Royal Aircraft Establishment for carrier rockets based on the Black Knight rocket, with the project being authorised in 1964. It was initially developed by Saunders-Roe, and later Westland Aircraft as the result of a merger. Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 paraffin (kerosene) and high test peroxide, a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide (85% hydrogen peroxide + 15% water). It was retired after only four launches in favour of using American Scout rockets, which the Ministry of Defence calculated to be cheaper than maintaining the Black Arrow programme.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Black_Arrow.jpg?width=300" alt="Black Arrow"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_(rocket)">Black Knight (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 0.91</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1958-07-11</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1958-09-02</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Woomera Prohibited Area</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Black Knight was a British research sounding rocket, originally developed to test and verify the design of a re-entry vehicle for the Blue Streak missile. It was the United Kingdom's first indigenous space launcher. Design work on what would become the Black Knight launch vehicle commenced in 1955, being performed by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) and British manufacturer Saunders-Roe. Saunders-Roe was the principal manufacturer for the Black Knight at its facility on the Isle of Wight. On 7 September 1958, the first Black Knight was launched at Woomera in Australia. Between 1958 and 1965, a total of 22 launch vehicles were fired, none of which suffered any major failures. After 22 launches, the Black Knight programme was closed. The success of the Black Knight as a cheap and successful test vehicle led to many studies being performed into further derivatives of the vehicle, including its adaption to serve as an intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and as a launch vehicle, including one proposal, which was based on the Blue Streak missile and the Black Knight, known as the Black Prince. Technology and experience gained on the Black Knight programme would contribute to the subsequent Black Arrow expendable launch vehicle programme.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Black_Knight_Rocket_Edinburgh.jpg?width=300" alt="Black Knight (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Streak_(missile)">Blue Streak (missile)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 24.384</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1958-07-11</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1958-09-02</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired since 1971</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Guiana Space Centre, Woomera Test Range</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The de Havilland Propellers Blue Streak was a British Intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), and later the first stage of the Europa satellite launch vehicle. Blue Streak was cancelled without entering full production. The project was intended to maintain an independent British nuclear deterrent, replacing the V bomber fleet which would become obsolete by 1965. The operational requirement for the missile was issued in 1955 and the design was complete by 1957. During development, it became clear that the missile system was too expensive and too vulnerable to a surprise attack. The missile project was cancelled in 1960, with US-led Skybolt the preferred replacement. Partly to avoid political embarrassment from the cancellation, the UK government proposed that the rocket be used as the first stage of a civilian satellite launcher called Black Prince. As the cost was thought to be too great for the UK alone, international collaboration was sought. This led to the formation of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO), with Blue Streak used as the first stage of a carrier rocket named Europa. Europa was tested at Woomera Test Range, Australia and later at Kourou in French Guiana. Following launch failures, the ELDO project was cancelled in 1972 and Blue Streak with it.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Blue_Streak.jpg?width=300" alt="Blue Streak (missile)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORONA_(rocket)">CORONA (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 10.0</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 30.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Under development</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> </div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">CORONA is a single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle capable of performing vertical takeoff and landing.

It was derived from the Titan 34D, and was originally proposed as a medium-lift expendable launch system for the US Air Force, who selected the Delta II instead. Development was continued as a commercial launch system, and the first rocket flew in 1990. Due to higher costs than contemporary rockets such as the Ariane 4, orders were not forthcoming, and the CT-3 was retired in 1992. The Commercial Titan III differed from the Titan 34D in that it had a stretched second stage, and a larger payload fairing to accommodate dual satellite payloads. All four launches occurred from LC-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The first carried two communications satellites, Skynet 4A and JCSAT-2, and was launched at 00:07 UTC on 1 January 1990, which was 19:07 local time on 31 December 1989, making it the only orbital launch to have occurred in different years between the launch site and UTC. The launch received the International Designator 1990-001, using the UTC date. The second launch occurred on 14 March, and carried the Intelsat 603 satellite. The rocket's second stage failed to separate, and the payload could only be released from the rocket by means of jettisoning its kick motor. It was later visited by Space Shuttle Endeavour, on mission STS-49. Astronauts attached a new kick motor, which raised the satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit, as had originally been planned. The third launch, on 23 June, carried Intelsat 604, and was successful. There was no Commercial Titan III launch in 1991, due to maintenance work at Launch Complex 40. The final flight of the Commercial Titan III occurred on 25 September 1992, and placed NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft into heliocentric orbit, by means of a Transfer Orbit Stage.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Commercial_Titan_3_launching_Mars_Observer.jpg?width=300" alt="Commercial Titan III"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone-4M">Cyclone-4M</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> $45M-$60M</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 4.0</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 38.7</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> In development</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Canso, Nova Scotia</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Cyclone-4M is a Ukrainian carrier rocket which is being developed for commercial satellite launches.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cyclone-4m.jpg?width=300" alt="Cyclone-4M"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_0100">Delta 0100</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1972-07-23</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1973-11-06</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Vandenberg Air Force Base</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Delta 0100 series, also Delta 100, 0300 or 300 series, was an American expendable launch system which conducted orbital launches between 1968 and 1972.

The same first stage and boosters were used on all variants. The first stage was an , a further stretched version of the used on earlier versions, itself derived from the Thor missile. Four, six or nine Castor-2 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off. These improvements permitted the Delta 1000 series to lift 1,835 kg (4,045 lbs) to LEO or 635 kg (1,400 lbs) to GTO. The nickname "Straight-Eight" comes from the fact that its second stage variants had the same 8 ft. (2.4 m) diameter as the first stage; previous Delta second stages were smaller in diameter. Two different second stages were flown, depending on the variant: 
* The second stage, featuring the Aerojet AJ10-118G engine, was flown on three launches, with Explorer 47, 50 and 51; the Aerojet engine was flown for the (Anik A1) satellite launch (mistakenly marked as xx1x in Delta 1000 series) 
* The Delta-P second stage, featuring the new TRW TR-201 engine, was used for two launches each in 1973 and 1975. Some flights used a third stage, either the Thiokol Star-37D or Star-37E, for launches beyond low Earth orbit. One probe launched by the Delta 1000 series, Delta 1913, was Explorer 49 that was placed into lunar orbit on 10 June 1973. Delta 1000 rockets were launched from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg AFB and Launch Complex 17B at Cape Canaveral. All eight (1972-1975) launches were successful.

The Delta 1000, 2000 and 3000 series used surplus NASA Apollo program rockets engines for its first and second stages. The first stage was an Extended Long Tank Thor, re-engined with the Rocketdyne RS-27 replacing the earlier engine. The RS-27 engine was a rebranded H-1 engine used in the Saturn 1B with minor changes. Three or nine Castor-2 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off. The Delta-P second stage used the TRW TR-201 engine. The TR-201 engine was a Lunar Module Descent Engine reconfigured for fixed thrust output. Launches which required a three-stage configuration in order to reach higher orbits used the Thiokol Star-37D or Star-37E upper stage as an apogee kick motor. Delta 2000 launches occurred from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg AFB and both pads of Launch Complex 17 at Cape Canaveral. Forty-three out of forty-four launches were successful. The single failure being the maiden flight, 19 January 1974, which placed Skynet 2A into a useless orbit. A short circuit in an electronics package circuit board (on second stage) left the upper stages and satellite in an unstable low orbit (96 x 3,406 km x 37.6°) that rapidly decayed.

The Delta second stage developed an oxidizer leak about 40 seconds into launch so that when its burn began, the engine quickly lost thrust. In addition, the leaking LOX started pushing the stage off its proper flight path. The guidance system tried to compensate by repeatedly firing the attitude control jets, but this resulted in the rapid exhaustion of their propellant and the launch vehicle started tumbling uncontrollably.

As such, it has been referred to as being a key predecessor for all subsequent European launcher projects. During 1962, development of the Diamant commenced as the inaugural spacecraft project of France's space agency, the Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES). As a project, it was derived from the military program Pierres précieuses (fr.: gemstones) that included the five prototypes Agate, Topaze, Emeraude, Rubis and Saphir (Agate, Topaz, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire), and drew heavily upon the knowledge and technologies that had been previously developed. On 26 November 1965, the Diamant A performed its maiden flight. Out of a total of 12 launch attempts to be performed between 1965 and 1975, 9 of these were successful. Most notably, on 26 November 1965, the Diamant was used to successfully launch the first French satellite, named Astérix. Three successive versions of the Diamant rocket were developed, designated A, B and BP4. All versions had three stages and a payload of approximately 150 kg for a 200 km orbit. Despite the success of the Diamant as a launcher, France ultimately chose to terminate further work on its national launcher program in favor of participation in the multi-European programme to produce what would become the Ariane launcher in 1975.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Diamant_P6230215.jpg?width=300" alt="Diamant"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnepr_(rocket)">Dnepr (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> </div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1999-04-21</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2015-03-25</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Baikonur Cosmodrome, Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 109, Dombarovsky (air base)</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Dnepr rocket (Russian: Днепр, romanized: Dnepr; Ukrainian: Дніпро, romanized: Dnipró) was a space launch vehicle named after the Dnieper River.

It built on the experiences of the Véronique and Vesta programs, and though it was only used for one year, it tested important technologies that were used in later French launch vehicles, from the Topaze and Saphir sounding rockets to the Diamant, the multi-stage orbital rocket that was used to launch France's first satellite, the Asterix-1. Emeraude was launched exclusively from the Centre interarmées d'essais d'engins spéciaux (CIEES) launch site in Hammaguir, Algeria. Its codename, VE121, means Vehicle Experimental; 1 stage, liquid propellant (code 2), guided (code 1). The rocket was liquid-fueled and carried 12.8 tonnes of fuel and oxidizer—nitric acid and gasoline turpentine—which were pressure-fed into the four Vexin-B engines, providing a total of 301.55 kN of thrust. Pitch and yaw control were provided by gimbaling the four engines while roll control was provided by aerodynamic fins. The rocket could carry a 385 kilograms (849 lb) payload to an altitude of 200 km. Emeraude was considered part of the "pierres précieuses" ("precious stones") rocket family, the family of sounding rockets that led up to the Diamant orbital rocket. The first launches of Emeraude – on June 15, June 17, and October 20, 1964 – were failures, casting doubt on the entire pierres précieuses program. These three launches had failed because of propellant sloshing due to pogo oscillation, a problem that was fixed before the fourth launch. However, the final two launches – on February 27 and May 13, 1965 – went well, with the latter flight reaching an altitude of 180 km. The final test carried a dummy Topaze stage for testing the aerodynamics of Emeraude's successor, the Saphir.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/SEREB_Saphir_Emeraude_rockets.gif?width=300" alt="Emeraude (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia_(rocket)">Energia (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 2400.0</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 17.65</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 58.765</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 0</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1998-08-26</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2011-09-10</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Baikonur Cosmodrome</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Energia (Russian: Энергия, romanized: Energiya, lit. 'Energy'; GRAU 11K25) was a 1980s super-heavy lift launch vehicle.

Control system main developer enterprise was the Khartron NPO "Electropribor". The Energia used four strap-on boosters each powered by a four-chamber RD-170 engine burning kerosene/LOX, and a central core stage with four single-chamber RD-0120 (11D122) engines fueled by liquid hydrogen/LOX. The launch vehicle had two functionally different operational variants: Energia-Polyus, the initial test configuration, in which the Polyus system was used as a final stage intended to put the payload into orbit, and Energia-Buran, in which the Buran orbiter was the payload and the source of the orbit insertion impulse. The launch vehicle had the capacity to place about 100 tonnes in Low Earth orbit, up to 20 tonnes to geostationary orbit and up to 32 tonnes by translunar trajectory into lunar orbit. The launch vehicle made just two flights before being discontinued. Since 2016, there have been attempts to revive the launch vehicle, reusing an updated version of its booster engine in the Soyuz-5 rocket.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Energia-Polyus_drawing.png?width=300" alt="Energia (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_(rocket)">Epsilon (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> 3.9E7</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 91.0</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 2.5</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 24.4</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2002-11-20</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2018-09-15</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Active</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Uchinoura Space Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Epsilon Launch Vehicle, or Epsilon rocket (イプシロンロケット, Ipushiron roketto) (formerly Advanced Solid Rocket), is a Japanese solid-fuel rocket designed to launch scientific satellites.

It was developed with the aim to delivering space access technology, and more specifically to facilitate the deployment of European-wide telecommunication and meteorological satellites into orbit. The Blue Streak missile predated the Europa programme, having originally been developed by Britain primarily for military purposes, however it was cancelled in 1960. Efforts to repurpose the Blue Streak, such as the studied Black Prince expendable launch system, eventually culminated in the multinational Europa programme. Workshare on the programme was shared between the various members of the ELDO based upon their financial contributions. The Europa launcher itself primarily consisted of the Blue Streak, Coralie, and Astris rocket stages. The programme proceeded to perform multiple test launches, however these frequently resulted in partial failures. In addition, Britain decided to pull out of the ELDO organisation, and thus Europa, to focus on the rival British Black Arrow launcher instead. Confidence in the programme had diminished due to the poor reliability figures, and this led to its termination. While Europa was ultimately cancelled, the ambition for such a launcher was still present and supported by the majority of ELDO members and, following its reformation into ESA in 1974, the agency proceeded to develop the Ariane family of launchers, which would prove to be a commercial success with hundreds of launches performed.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Europa2vrp.jpg?width=300" alt="Europa (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1">Falcon 1</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> 7000000.0</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2006-03-24</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2009-07-14</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Omelek Island</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Falcon 1 was a small-lift launch vehicle that was operated from 2006 to 2009 by SpaceX, an American aerospace manufacturer.

The rocket has two stages. The first (booster) stage carries the second stage and payload to a certain altitude, after which the second stage lifts the payload to its ultimate destination. The rocket evolved through several versions. V1.0 flew from 2010–2013, V1.1 flew from 2013–2016, while V1.2 Full Thrust first launched in 2015, encompassing the Block 5 variant, flying since May 2018. The booster is capable of landing vertically to facilitate reuse. This feat was first achieved on flight 20 in December 2015. Since then, SpaceX has successfully landed boosters over 100 times. Individual boosters have flown as many as fourteen flights. Both stages are powered by SpaceX Merlin engines, using cryogenic liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) as propellants. The heaviest payloads flown to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) were Intelsat 35e carrying 6,761 kg (14,905 lb), and Telstar 19V with 7,075 kg (15,598 lb). The former was launched into an advantageous super-synchronous transfer orbit, while the latter went into a lower-energy GTO, with an apogee well below the geostationary altitude. Falcon 9 is human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the ISS. Falcon 9 is certified for the National Security Space Launch program and NASA Launch Services Program as "Category 3", which can launch the most expensive, important, and complex NASA missions. The first mission launched on 8 October 2012. As of January 2021, Falcon 9 had the most launches among U.S. rockets. It is the only U.S. rocket certified for transporting humans to the International Space Station. It is the only commercial rocket to ever launch humans to orbit. On 24 January 2021, Falcon 9 set a record for the most satellites launched by a single rocket, carrying 143 into orbit.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Falcon_9_logo.svg?width=300" alt="Falcon 9"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_Block_5">Falcon 9 Block 5</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 0</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2018-05-11</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2022-11-26</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Active</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40, Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A, Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Falcon 9 Block 5 is a partially reusable two-stage-to-orbit medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured in the United States by SpaceX.

On April 8, 2016, the Full Thrust version of the Falcon 9 family was the first launch vehicle on an orbital trajectory to successfully vertically land a first stage. The landing followed a technology development program conducted from 2013 to 2015. Some of the required technology advances, such as landing legs, were pioneered on the Falcon 9 v1.1 version, but that version never landed intact. Starting in 2017, previously flown first-stage boosters were reused to launch new payloads into orbit. This quickly became routine, in 2018 and in 2019 more than half of all Falcon 9 flights reused a booster. In 2020 the fraction of reused boosters increased to 81%. Falcon 9 Full Thrust is a substantial upgrade over the previous Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket, which flew its last mission in January 2016.

Following the second Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) launch, the initial version Falcon 9 v1.0 was retired from use and replaced by the v1.1 version. Falcon 9 v1.1 was a significant evolution from Falcon 9 v1.0, with 60 percent more thrust and weight. Its maiden flight carried out a demonstration mission with the CASSIOPE satellite on 29 September 2013, the sixth overall launch of any Falcon 9. Both stages of the two-stage-to-orbit vehicle used liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellants. The Falcon 9 v1.1 could lift payloads of 13,150 kilograms (28,990 lb) to low Earth orbit, and 4,850 kilograms (10,690 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit, which places the Falcon 9 design in the medium-lift range of launch systems. Beginning in April 2014, the Dragon capsules were propelled by Falcon 9 v1.1 to deliver cargo to the International Space Station under the Commercial Resupply Services contract with NASA. This version was also intended to ferry astronauts to the ISS under a NASA Commercial Crew Development contract signed in September 2014 but those missions are now scheduled to use the upgraded Falcon 9 Full Thrust version, first flown in December 2015.

Though the SM-68A was operational for only three years, it spawned numerous follow-on models that were a part of the U.S. arsenal and space launch capability. The Titan I was unique among the Titan models in that it used liquid oxygen and RP-1 as propellants; all subsequent versions used storable propellants instead. Originally designed as a backup in case the U.S. Air Force's SM-65 Atlas missile development ran into problems, the Titan was ultimately beaten into service by Atlas. Deployment went ahead anyway to more rapidly increase the number of missiles on alert and because the Titan's missile silo basing was more survivable than Atlas. The succeeding LGM-25C Titan II served in the U.S. nuclear deterrent until 1987 and had increased capacity and range in addition to the different propellants.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Titan_1_ICBM.jpg?width=300" alt="HGM-25A Titan I"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOPE-X">HOPE-X</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 14.0</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 9.699999999999999</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 15.2</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Project cancelled</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> </div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">HOPE (H-II Orbiting Plane) was a Japanese experimental spaceplane project designed by a partnership between NASDA and NAL (both now part of JAXA), started in the 1980s.

In 2004, the company won a NASA contract to fly supply missions to ISS. At the time, Kistler claimed that the design of the K-1 was 75% complete, and the $227 million NASA contract would be used to complete development and the first flights. SpaceX protested, suggesting that the presence of well-known former NASA engineers biased the decision in favor of Kistler. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) sided with SpaceX and NASA suspended the contract in favor of a new process, the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. Lacking funding to complete development, in 2006 Kistler was purchased by Rocketplane Limited, Inc, who had previously been developing a competing concept. Both SpaceX and the new Rocketplane Kistler won COTS contracts in August 2006, but after failing to meet several financial milestones, NASA announced in October 2007 that it was terminating funding for the project.

The rocket is carried to the upper atmosphere on a modified Boeing 747-400, named Cosmic Girl, and released over the Pacific Ocean. Initial work on the program was done by Virgin Galactic, another Virgin Group subsidiary, before a separate entity — Virgin Orbit — was formed in 2017 to complete development and operate the launch service provider business as a separate entity from the passenger-carrying Virgin Galactic business. The first successful flight was on 17 January 2021, which delivered a payload of 10 CubeSats to low Earth orbit (LEO). Two additional launches also successfully made it to orbit. LauncherOne was the first all liquid-fuelled air-launched orbital rocket. A previous test flight was unsuccessful on 25 May 2020, when the rocket failed to reach space. From 2007 to 2015, Virgin had intended LauncherOne to be a somewhat smaller vehicle with a 200 kg (440 lb) payload to low Earth orbit. In 2015, Virgin modified the vehicle design to better target their intended market, and increased the vehicle payload capacity to 300 kg (660 lb) launched to a 500 km (310 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for CubeSats and small payloads.

It is the first Chinese launch vehicle designed to use exclusively non-hypergolic liquid propellants. It is the fifth iteration of the Long March rocket family. There are currently two CZ-5 variants: CZ-5 and CZ-5B. The maximum payload capacities are approximately 25,000 kg (55,000 lb) to low Earth orbit (for CZ-5B) and approximately 14,000 kg (31,000 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (for CZ-5). As of 2021, a 3-core human-rated variant, referred to as CZ-5G, designed for manned moon mission, is under development; this variant will be capable of launching a crewed spacecraft into lunar orbit. The Long March 5 roughly matches the capabilities of American NSSL heavy-lift launch vehicles such as the Delta IV Heavy. It is currently the most powerful member of the Long March rocket family and the world's third most powerful orbital launch vehicle currently in operation, trailing the Falcon Heavy and Delta IV Heavy. The first CZ-5 launched from Wenchang Space Launch Site on 3 November 2016 and placed its payload in a suboptimal but workable initial orbit. The second CZ-5 rocket, launched on 2 July 2017, failed due to an engine problem in the first stage. After an interval of almost two and a half years, the Long March 5 vehicle's return to flight mission (third launch) successfully occurred on 27 December 2019 with the launch and placement of the experimental Shijian-20 communications satellite into geostationary transfer orbit, thereby opening the way for the successful launch of Tianwen 1 Mars mission, lunar Chang'e 5 sample-return mission, and the modular space station, which require the lifting capabilities of a heavy lift launch vehicle.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/长征五号遥二火箭转场.jpg?width=300" alt="Long March 5"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_6">Long March 6</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2015-09-19</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2022-09-26</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Active</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Long March 6 (Chinese: 长征六号运载火箭) or Chang Zheng 6 as in pinyin, abbreviated LM 6 for export or CZ 6 within China, is a Chinese liquid-fuelled launch vehicle of the Long March family, which was developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) and the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST).

The first stage of the Long March 6 was derived from the booster rockets being developed for the Long March 5 rocket. It is powered by a YF-100 engine, which generates 1,340 kN (300,000 lbf) of thrust from burning kerosene and LOX as rocket fuel and oxidiser. This was the first flight of the new engine design. An enlarged variant, the Long March 6A, which has four strap-on solid boosters, an elongated stage one, a new stage two with the same diameter as the first stage, and a payload capacity of at least 4000 kg to Sun-synchronous orbit, made its maiden flight on 29 March 2022.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Maiden_Flight_of_Long_March_6_Rocket.jpg?width=300" alt="Long March 6"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_7">Long March 7</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2016-06-25</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2022-09-13</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Active</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Wenchang Satellite Launch Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Long March 7 (Chinese: 长征七号运载火箭), or Chang Zheng 7 in pinyin, abbreviated LM-7 for export or CZ-7 within China, originally Long March 2F/H or Chang Zheng 2F/H, nicknamed Bingjian (冰箭; 'the Ice Arrow'), is a Chinese liquid-fuelled launch vehicle of the Long March family, developed by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CAST).

It was a member of the Mu family of rockets. The Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) began developing the M-V in 1990 at a cost of 15 billion yen. It has three stages and is 30.7 m (101 ft) high, 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) in diameter, and weighs about 140,000 kg (310,000 lb). It was capable of launching a satellite weighing 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) into an orbit as high as 250 km (160 mi). The first M-V rocket launched the HALCA radio astronomy satellite in 1997, and the second the Nozomi Mars explorer in July 1998.

A larger third stage was added along with a fourth stage that was designed to fire in-orbit to send the payload out of LEO. The basic R-7 core was also structurally strengthened and given more powerful engines. A rushed development produced multiple malfunctions of the upper stages, which led to its being replaced by the improved Molniya-M in 1964, but there were enough 8K78s left to continue flying them into 1967.

The original 8K78 booster had been the product of a rushed development program and its launch record was no better than the 8K72 Luna booster of 1958–1960. As 1962 ended, there had been 12 launches of 8K78s, 10 of which failed (five Blok L failures, four Blok I failures, and one failure caused by the Blok A core stage). The two successful launches had had their probes (Venera 1 and Mars 1) fail en route to their respective planetary targets. As such, work began at the Korolev Bureau to improve the basic 8K78 vehicle. The core and strap-ons engines were enhanced still further and the Kosberg Bureau completely redesigned the Blok I stage. The Blok L engine was also slightly enhanced. The first six 8K78Ms built used RD-0108 engines in the Blok I stage, which was also used in the two crewed Voskhod boosters, all subsequent 8K78Ms using RD-0110 engines which were shared with the Soyuz booster. The 8K78M was first launched in 1964; however, the existing stock of 8K78s had not been used up yet and they continued to fly until 1967. During 1967, the improved core stage and strap-ons from the Soyuz 11A57 were adopted and made standard on all R-7 based vehicles. It made 297 launches and experienced 21 failures. There were no failures of 8K78Ms caused by the core and strap-ons, and after 1968, all failures were caused by the Blok L stage until 2005 when one of the last boosters flown suffered a Blok I engine failure. The final flight of a Molniya-M lofted an Oko early warning satellite from Plesetsk on 30 September 2010 despite some apprehension that the launch vehicle, manufactured in 2005, had exceeded its storage life. It was replaced by the Soyuz-2/Fregat. Although originally developed for planetary probes, those had switched to the larger Proton booster by the 1970s due to increasing mass and complexity. For most of its operational life, the Molniya-M was used to launch its namesake Molniya and also Oko satellites into Molniya orbits, orbits of high eccentricity that allow satellites to dwell over polar regions.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Molniya-8K78M.svg?width=300" alt="Molniya-M"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-I_(rocket)">N-I (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 131.33</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 2.44</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 34.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2002-11-20</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2022-09-28</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Tanegashima</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The N-I or N-1 was a derivative of the American Thor-Delta rocket, produced under license in Japan.

The N1 was the Soviet counterpart to the US Saturn V and was intended to enable crewed travel to the Moon and beyond, with studies beginning as early as 1959. Its first stage, Block A, remains the most powerful rocket stage ever flown. However, all four first stages flown failed mid-flight because a lack of static test firings meant that plumbing issues and other adverse characteristics with the large cluster of thirty engines and its complex fuel and oxidizer feeder system were not revealed earlier in development. The N1-L3 version was designed to compete with the United States Apollo program to land a person on the Moon, using a similar lunar orbit rendezvous method. The basic N1 launch vehicle had three stages, which were to carry the L3 lunar payload into low Earth orbit with two cosmonauts. The L3 contained one stage for trans-lunar injection; another stage used for mid-course corrections, lunar orbit insertion, and the first part of the descent to the lunar surface; a single-pilot LK Lander spacecraft; and a two-pilot Soyuz 7K-LOK lunar orbital spacecraft for return to Earth. The N1-L3 was underfunded and rushed, starting development in October 1965, almost four years after the Saturn V. The project was badly derailed by the death of its chief designer Sergei Korolev in 1966. Each of the four attempts to launch an N1 failed, with the second attempt resulting in the vehicle crashing back onto its launch pad shortly after liftoff. The N1 program was suspended in 1974, and officially canceled in 1976. All details of the Soviet crewed lunar programs were kept secret until the USSR was nearing collapse in 1989.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/N1_1M1_mockup_on_the_launch_pad_at_the_Baikonur_Cosmodrome_in_late_1967.jpg?width=300" alt="N1 (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOTS-EV-1_Pilot">NOTS-EV-1 Pilot</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 0.95</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 0.76</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 4.4</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 10</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2002-11-20</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2022-09-28</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> China Lake, Naval Air Station Point Mugu</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The NOTS-EV-1 Pilot, better known as NOTSNIK (pronounced notsnik a play on "sputnik") was an expendable launch system and anti-satellite weapon developed by the United States Navy's United States Naval Ordnance Test Station (NOTS).

The vehicle is named after Alan Shepard, the first American astronaut in space. The vehicle is capable of vertical takeoff and vertical landing, and can carry a crew. The first uncrewed test flight of the New Shepard vehicle was in 2015. Blue Origin began testing prototype engines and vehicles in 2006 and completed full-scale engine development in 2015. Testing continued in 2016 and 2017, and Blue Origin planned its first crewed test flight for 2018, but it was delayed until 2021. As of 4 August 2022, New Shepard has flown 32 passengers into space. Tickets for commercial flights began to be sold on May 5, 2021, for flights carrying up to six people. New Shepard is a one-stage rocket consisting of a crew capsule and a booster rocket. The capsule can seat six passengers. The booster rocket, powered by a BE-3 liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen engine, propels the capsule to an altitude of over 100 km, where passengers can experience a few minutes of weightlessness before the capsule returns to Earth. The vehicle is designed to be fully reusable, with the capsule and booster rocket returning to Earth via parachute and landing vertically on the ground. This allows Blue Origin to significantly reduce the cost of space tourism, making the experience more accessible to the general public. Blue Origin has successfully launched and landed the New Shepard vehicle 21 times.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/New_shepard_launch_june_19_2016.jpg?width=300" alt="New Shepard"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Smoke">Nike Smoke</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 0.708</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 6.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1958-07-11</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Kennedy, Wallops Island</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Nike Smoke was a sounding rocket, part of a research project on the behavior of the horizontal winds in the upper atmosphere, developed by NASA in the 1960s based on the Nike booster.

Nuri is developed by Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI). All three stages use indigenously developed launch vehicle engines, making Nuri the first indigenously developed South Korean orbital launch vehicle (the Naro-1 launch vehicle used Russian-made first stage). The South Korean government has set SpaceX as a "role model", striving to develop relatively cheap and reliable rockets competitive enough for the commercial launch market. On 21 October 2021, Nuri made its initial orbital launch attempt at 08:00 UTC and it launched a 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) dummy satellite payload into what was planned to be a 700 km (430 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO). However, despite the payload reaching the targeted apogee (700 km), the third stage shut down about 46 seconds earlier than planned and the payload did not achieve orbital speed. Nuri made its second flight on 21 June 2022, 07:00 UTC, with a payload of 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) including a 1,300 kg (2,900 lb) dummy satellite payload and a 180 kg (400 lb) performance verification satellite (PVSAT) including four cube satellites. The second launch was successful, putting all the satellites onto the 700 km (430 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).

OmegA was intended for launching U.S. national security satellites, as part of the U.S. Department of the Air Force National Security Space Launch (NSSL) replacement program. The OmegA design consisted of new composite solid rocket stages with a cryogenic upper stage provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne, replacing earlier plans to use an upper stage engine provided by Blue Origin. The OmegA design was similar to the defunct Ares I and Liberty projects, both of which consisted of a five segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) and a cryogenic second stage. It was intended to be launched from Kennedy Space Center LC-39B or Vandenberg Air Force Base SLC-6. OmegA was proposed as a vehicle to launch national security satellites for the United States Space Force and other government agencies, including to geostationary transfer orbit. The launch vehicle could theoretically launch commercial payloads as well, but was not designed at a price point to make private competitive launches likely. Orbital ATK claimed in 2016 that crewed spacecraft could also be launched, just as the predecessor Ares I and Liberty rockets, which were designed to be able to also launch the Orion space capsule. By 2016, actual development was to get underway only once the Air Force reached a funding decision. In October 2018, the Air Force announced that Northrop Grumman was awarded $792 million for initial development of the OmegA launch vehicle.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Omega_logo.svg?width=300" alt="OmegA"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Sciences_X-34">Orbital Sciences X-34</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 8.1648</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 3.5052</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Cancelled (March, 2001)</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Dryden Flight Research Center, Kennedy Space Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Orbital Sciences X-34 was intended to be a low-cost testbed for demonstrating "key technologies" that could be integrated into the Reusable Launch Vehicle program. It was intended to be an autonomous pilotless craft powered by a "Fastrac" liquid-propellant rocket engine, capable of reaching Mach 8 and performing 25 test flights per year. The X-34 began as a program for a suborbital reusable-rocket technology demonstrator. In early 2001, the first flight vehicle was near completion, but the program was ended due to budget concerns. Up to this point, the project had encompassed spending of just under $112 million: $85.7M from the original contract with designer Orbital Sciences, $16M from NASA and various government agencies for testing, and an additional $10M for Orbital Sciences to adapt its L-1011 carrier to accommodate the X-34. The program was officially canceled by NASA on March 31, 2001. The unpowered prototype had been used only for towing and captive flight tests when the project was canceled. The two demonstrators remained in storage at Edwards Air Force Base until they were temporarily moved to Mojave, California, in late 2010. This prompted some speculation that they might be restored to flight status. As of April 2020, one of the fuselages was seen lying in parts in a scrapyard in nearby Rosamond, California.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Orbital_Sciences_X34.jpg?width=300" alt="Orbital Sciences X-34"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(rocket)">Orion (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> </div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Orion is the designation of a small American sounding rocket.

PSLV can also launch small size satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). Some notable payloads launched by PSLV include India's first lunar probe Chandrayaan-1, India's first interplanetary mission, Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan) and India's first space observatory, Astrosat. PSLV has gained credibility as a leading provider of rideshare services for small satellites, owing to its numerous multi-satellite deployment campaigns with auxiliary payloads, usually ride-sharing along with an Indian primary payload. As of June 2022, PSLV has launched 345 foreign satellites from 36 countries. Most notable among these was the launch of PSLV-C37 on 15 February 2017, successfully deploying 104 satellites in sun-synchronous orbit, tripling the previous record held by Russia for the highest number of satellites sent to space on a single launch, until 24 January 2021, when SpaceX launched the Transporter-1 mission on a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 143 satellites into orbit.

The R-7A first flew on 23 December 1959, entered service on 31 December of the same year, and was formally accepted on 20 January 1960. It was declared fully operational on 12 September 1960 and was retired from service in 1968. Twenty eight test launches were conducted with three failures. Most test launches occurred from Sites 1/5 and 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The main operational base for R-7A missiles was Plesetsk Cosmodrome, where four launch pads were used at Sites 41/1, 16/2, 43/3 and 43/4. Baikonur Site 31/6 was also used for operational missiles. Another base near Krasnoyarsk was proposed, but later cancelled. The R-7A was designed to carry a nuclear warhead; however, there was only one occasion where a live warhead was loaded onto a missile, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. After the missile had been armed, it was rolled out to Site 41/1 at Plesetsk, and would have had a response time of 8-12 hours, should an order to launch it have been given. In the event of nuclear war, other missiles would have been armed as required, in accordance with the Soviet policy of storing missiles and warheads separately.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/R-7_(7A)_misil.svg?width=300" alt="R-7A Semyorka"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RLV-TD">RLV-TD</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 1.0</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 16.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1958-07-11</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Testing prototypes</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Satish Dhawan Space Centre</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">RLV-TD is India's first uncrewed flying testbed developed for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)'s Reusable Launch Vehicle Technology Demonstration Programme.

It was built for the U.S. Air Force by the Convair Division of General Dynamics at an assembly plant located in Kearny Mesa, San Diego. Atlas became operational in October 1959, but was soon made obsolete as an ICBM by new development, and was retired from this role by 1965. Atlas required long preparation times which made it unsuitable for a quick launch ICBM. However, this was not a requirement for planned space launches, and so Atlas-derived launch vehicles served a long history as space launchers. Even before its ICBM use ended in 1965, Atlas had placed four Project Mercury astronauts in orbit and was becoming the foundation for a family of successful space launch vehicles, most notably Atlas Agena and Atlas Centaur. Mergers led to the acquisition of the Atlas Centaur line by the United Launch Alliance. Today ULA supports the larger Atlas V, which combines the Centaur upper stage with a new booster. Until 2001, many retired Atlas ICBMs were refurbished and combined with upper stages to launch satellites.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Atlas_2E_Ballistic_Missile.jpg?width=300" alt="SM-65 Atlas"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM-65A_Atlas">SM-65A Atlas</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 4</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1957-06-11</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1958-06-03</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 12</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Convair SM-65A Atlas, or Atlas A was the first full-scale prototype of the Atlas missile, which first flew on 11 June 1957.

The propulsion system used on the initial Atlas As was an early version of the Rocketdyne MA-1 engines with conical thrust chambers that produced a mere 135,000 pounds of thrust, compared with the 360,000 pounds of the fully operational Atlas D. Several pieces of hardware found on the operational Atlas were either missing on the A-series or only partially implemented. Powered flight on the A-series would last about two minutes and compared to later Atlases, long pad hold-down times, with up to 11 seconds between engine start and launcher release. The first three Atlases built were used merely for static firing tests with Missile 4A being the first flight article.

Atlas C was similar to Atlas B, but had a larger LOX tank and smaller RP-1 tank due to technical changes to the Rocketdyne engines. Improvements in materials and manufacturing processes also resulted in lighter-weight components than the Atlas A and B. Booster burn time was much longer than the A/B series, up to 151 seconds. All launches took place from LC-12 at CCAS.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Atlas_C.jpg?width=300" alt="SM-65C Atlas"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM-65D_Atlas">SM-65D Atlas</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 118.8432</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 3.048</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 25.149048</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 32</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1966-11-28</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2018-09-15</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 11, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 12, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 13, Vandenberg Air Force Base, Vandenberg Air Force Base Launch Complex 576</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The SM-65D Atlas, or Atlas D, was the first operational version of the U.S. Atlas missile.

It was later developed as a launch vehicle to carry a payload to low Earth orbit on its own, and later to geosynchronous orbit, to the Moon, Venus, or Mars with the Agena or Centaur upper stage. Atlas D was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11, 12, 13 and 14, and Vandenberg Air Force Base at Launch Complex 576. The fully operational D-series Atlas was similar to the R&D model Atlas B and C, but incorporated a number of design changes implemented as a result of lessons learned during test flights. In addition, the D-series had the full-up Rocketdyne MA-2 propulsion system with 360,000 pounds-force (1,600 kN) of thrust versus the 250,000 pounds-force (1,100 kN) of thrust in the Atlas B/C's engines. Operational Atlas D missiles retained radio ground guidance aside from a few R&D launches which tested the inertial guidance system designed for the Atlas E/F, and the Atlas D would be the basis for most space launcher variants of Atlas.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Atlas-icbm-erection-large.jpg?width=300" alt="SM-65D Atlas"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM-65E_Atlas">SM-65E Atlas</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 15</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1960-10-11</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1995-03-24</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 11, Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex 576, Vandenberg AFB Operational Silo Test Facility, Vandenberg Air Force Base</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The SM-65E Atlas, or Atlas-E, was an operational variant of the Atlas missile.

Following retirement as an ICBM, the Atlas-E, along with the Atlas-F, was refurbished for orbital launches as the Atlas E/F. The last Atlas E/F launch was conducted on March 24, 1995, using a rocket which had originally been built as an Atlas E. As fully operational ICBMs, the Atlas E and F, which differed only in guidance systems, had upgraded engines and inertial control instead of the Atlas D's radio ground guidance. The ignition system was also different from the one used on the D-series, which used a "wet" start, meaning that the propellants were injected into the combustion chamber prior to ignition, and a hypergolic igniter on the fully developed version. The Atlas E/F for comparison used pyrotechnic cartridges and a dry start (ignition coming before propellant injection) for an extremely rapid ignition that required no hold-down time on the pad to prevent combustion instability. The booster engines had separate gas generators unlike the Atlas D which had one gas generator for both engines. The launcher system used for the E and F series was also different from the D series, eliminating the hold-down arms in favor of a mechanism that would immediately release the missile as thrust built up. Atlas-E launches were conducted from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Launch Complexes 11 and 13, and Vandenberg Air Force Base at OSTF-1, LC-576 and SLC-3.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Atlas-E.jpg?width=300" alt="SM-65E Atlas"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SM-65F_Atlas">SM-65F Atlas</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 17</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1961-08-08</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1981-06-23</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 11, Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex 576, Vandenberg AFB Operational Silo Test Facility, Vandenberg Air Force Base</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The SM-65F Atlas, or Atlas-F, was the final operational variant of the Atlas missile, only differing from the Atlas E in the launch facility and guidance package used. It first flew on 8 August 1961, and was deployed as an operational ICBM between 1961 and 1966. Following retirement as an ICBM, the Atlas-F, along with the Atlas-E, was refurbished for orbital launches as the Atlas E/F. The Atlas E and F also differed in their launch facilities; Atlas E utilized the same coffin silos as Atlas D missiles, with the missile stored horizontally and raised upright for launch. Atlas F for comparison used a vertical silo with an elevator similar to the Titan I. The Atlas F was originally conceived when the Air Force decided that the coffin silos used for the Atlas D and E were too exposed and vulnerable to enemy attack. Atlas E and F used the MA-3 propulsion system which had a separate gas generator for all three engines, unlike the Atlas D where one gas generator drove both booster turbopumps. In addition, they used pyrotechnic cartridges for rapid starting and the gas generators and pumps were mounted on each booster engine instead of being placed in the central thrust section. This setup was designed for ease of service and engine swapping in the field, while the Atlas D's simpler configuration was considered preferable for space launches. Total thrust of the MA-3 was 375,000 pounds-force (1,670 kN). Atlas E/F used the ARMA inertial guidance system rather than Atlas D's radio ground guidance; some IOC (Initial Operational Capability) Atlas D flights tested the ARMA system instead of the standard GE Mod II radio guidance. Aside from minor differences in the ARMA on the Atlas E and F, the major difference between the two consisted of differently-placed quick fill lines for the two silo systems used. Most refurbished Atlas F space launches used solid-fueled upper stages, a notable exception being Missile 23F which launched Seasat, a NASA oceanography satellite, on June 27, 1978, the last Atlas-Agena vehicle flown. The final Atlas F launch took place on June 23, 1981 when Missile 87F successfully placed a NOAA weather satellite into orbit. Atlas E/F space launchers were given an extensive tear-down and rebuild by Convair and the ARMA system replaced with the GE Mod II guidance system.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Atlas-F.jpg?width=300" alt="SM-65F Atlas"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAR_(spaceplane)">SOAR (spaceplane)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> </div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">SOAR was a partially reusable air-launched spaceplane launch system concept designed to launch small satellites on a suborbital or orbital trajectory.

After fuel depletion at about 80 kilometers altitude, the plane was planned to release its payload before gliding back and landing on Earth. The launch vehicle was planned to also have low Earth orbit capability when launched in conjunction with an expendable upper stage. Swiss Space Systems has contracted the Russian firm RKK Energia to develop the upper stage. With an upper stage, the spacecraft was planned to be able to launch a 250 kilogram payload into orbit. Swiss Space Systems claimed that the spaceplane could cost about one fourth than current suborbital launch costs. The spaceplane was notionally targeted to have its first test launch by 2017.

The design was for a three-stage launch vehicle that could launch 45,000 kilograms (99,000 lb) to low Earth orbit and send 18,000 kilograms (40,000 lb) to the Moon via trans-lunar injection. U.S. President Kennedy's proposal on May 25, 1961, of an explicit crewed lunar landing goal spurred NASA to solidify its launch vehicle requirements for a lunar landing. A week earlier, William Fleming (Office of Space Flight Programs, NASA Headquarters) chaired an ad hoc committee to conduct a six-week study of the requirements for a lunar landing. Judging the direct ascent approach to be the most feasible, they concentrated their attention accordingly, and proposed circumlunar flights in late 1965 using the Saturn C-3 launch vehicle. In early June 1961, Bruce Lundin, deputy director of the Lewis Research Center, led a week-long study of six different rendezvous possibilities. The alternatives included Earth-orbital rendezvous (EOR), lunar-orbital rendezvous (LOR), Earth and lunar rendezvous, and rendezvous on the lunar surface, employing Saturn C-1s, C-3s, and Nova designs. Lundin's committee concluded that rendezvous enjoyed distinct advantages over direct ascent and recommended an Earth-orbital rendezvous using two or three Saturn C-3s. NASA announced on September 7, 1961, that the government-owned Michoud Ordnance Plant near New Orleans, Louisiana, would be the site for fabrication and assembly of the Saturn C-3 first stage as well as larger vehicles in the Saturn program. Finalists were two government-owned plants in St. Louis and New Orleans. The height of the factory roof at Michoud meant that a launch vehicle with eight F-1 engines (Nova class, Saturn C-8) could not be built; four or five engines (first stage) would have to be the maximum (Saturn C-5) This decision ended consideration of a Nova class launch vehicle for a direct ascent to the Moon or as a heavy-lift companion with the Saturn C-3 for Earth orbit rendezvous.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Proposed_Saturn_C-3_Apollo_Configuration.jpg?width=300" alt="Saturn C-3"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_C-8">Saturn C-8</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 4770.26</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 12.192</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 131.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Study 1962</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Kennedy Space Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Saturn C-8 was the largest member of the Saturn series of rockets to be designed. It was a potential alternative to the Nova rocket, should NASA have chosen a direct ascent method of lunar exploration for the Apollo program. The first stage was an increased-diameter version of the S-IC. The second stage was an increased-diameter version of the S-II. Both of these stages had eight engines, as opposed to the standard five. The third stage was a stretched S-IVB stage, which retained its original diameter and engine. NASA announced on September 7, 1961, that the government-owned Michoud Ordnance Plant near New Orleans, Louisiana, would be the site for fabrication and assembly of the Saturn first stages as well as larger vehicles in the Saturn program. Finalists were two government-owned plants in St. Louis and New Orleans.

Ultimately, the lunar orbit rendezvous ("LOR") concept approved in 1962 rendered the C-8 obsolete, and the smaller Saturn C-5 was developed instead under the designation "Saturn V", as the LOR spacecraft was within its payload capacity. The Saturn C-8 configuration was never taken further than the design process, as it was too large and costly.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/SatC8.svg?width=300" alt="Saturn C-8"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_I">Saturn I</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 0</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2015-12-22</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1965-07-30</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> </div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 34, Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 37</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Saturn I was a rocket designed as the United States' first medium lift launch vehicle for up to 20,000-pound (9,100 kg) low Earth orbit payloads. The rocket's first stage was built as a cluster of propellant tanks engineered from older rocket tank designs, leading critics to jokingly refer to it as "Cluster's Last Stand". Its development was taken over from the Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1958 by the newly formed civilian NASA. Its design proved sound and flexible. It was successful in initiating the development of liquid hydrogen-fueled rocket propulsion, launching the Pegasus satellites, and flight verification of the Apollo command and service module launch phase aerodynamics. Ten Saturn I rockets were flown before it was replaced by the heavy lift derivative Saturn IB, which used a larger, higher total impulse second stage and an improved guidance and control system. It also led the way to development of the super-heavy lift Saturn V which carried the first men to landings on the Moon in the Apollo program. President John F. Kennedy identified the Saturn I, and the SA-5 launch in particular, as being the point where US lift capability would surpass the Soviets, after being behind since Sputnik.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/SA-1_launch.jpg?width=300" alt="Saturn I"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_IB">Saturn IB</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 589.779792</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 6.605016</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 43.15968</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 0</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2013-12-28</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1965-07-30</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 37, Kennedy Space Center, Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Saturn IB (also known as the uprated Saturn I) was an American launch vehicle commissioned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the Apollo program. It uprated the Saturn I by replacing the S-IV second stage (90,000-pound-force (400,000 N), 43,380,000 lb-sec total impulse), with the S-IVB (200,000-pound-force (890,000 N), 96,000,000 lb-sec total impulse). The S-IB first stage also increased the S-I baseline's thrust from 1,500,000 pounds-force (6,700,000 N) to 1,600,000 pounds-force (7,100,000 N) and propellant load by 3.1%. This increased the Saturn I's low Earth orbit payload capability from 20,000 pounds (9,100 kg) to 46,000 pounds (21,000 kg), enough for early flight tests of a half-fueled Apollo command and service module (CSM) or a fully fueled Apollo Lunar Module (LM), before the larger Saturn V needed for lunar flight was ready. By sharing the S-IVB upper stage, the Saturn IB and Saturn V provided a common interface to the Apollo spacecraft. The only major difference was that the S-IVB on the Saturn V burned only part of its propellant to achieve Earth orbit, so it could be restarted for trans-lunar injection. The S-IVB on the Saturn IB needed all of its propellant to achieve Earth orbit. The Saturn IB launched two uncrewed CSM suborbital flights to a height of 162 km, one uncrewed LM orbital flight, and the first crewed CSM orbital mission (first planned as Apollo 1, later flown as Apollo 7). It also launched one orbital mission, AS-203, without a payload so the S-IVB would have residual liquid hydrogen fuel. This mission supported the design of the restartable version of the S-IVB used in the Saturn V, by observing the behavior of the liquid hydrogen in weightlessness. In 1973, the year after the Apollo lunar program ended, three Apollo CSM/Saturn IBs ferried crews to the Skylab space station. In 1975, one last Apollo/Saturn IB launched the Apollo portion of the joint US-USSR Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). A backup Apollo CSM/Saturn IB was assembled and made ready for a Skylab rescue mission, but never flown. The remaining Saturn IBs in NASA's inventory were scrapped after the ASTP mission, as no use could be found for them and all heavy lift needs of the US space program could be serviced by the cheaper and more versatile Titan III family and also the Space Shuttle.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Saturn_IB_launch_configurations.jpg?width=300" alt="Saturn IB"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_II">Saturn II</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 10.0584</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 50.9016</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Study 1966</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Kennedy Space Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Saturn II was a series of American expendable launch vehicles, studied by North American Aviation under NASA contract in 1966, derived from the Saturn V rocket used for the Apollo lunar program.

The rocket was human-rated, with three stages, and powered with liquid fuel. It was flown from 1967 to 1973. It was used for nine crewed flights to the Moon, and to launch Skylab, the first American space station. As of 2022, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Saturn V holds records for the heaviest payload launched and largest payload capacity to low Earth orbit: 310,000 lb (140,000 kg), which included the third stage and unburned propellant needed to send the Apollo command and service module and Lunar Module to the Moon. The largest production model of the Saturn family of rockets, the Saturn V was designed under the direction of Wernher von Braun at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama; the lead contractors were Boeing, North American Aviation, Douglas Aircraft Company, and IBM. A total of 15 flight-capable vehicles were built, plus three for ground testing. Thirteen were launched from Kennedy Space Center with no loss of crew or payload. A total of 24 astronauts were launched to the Moon from Apollo 8 (December 1968) to Apollo 17 (December 1972).</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Apollo_11_Launch_-_GPN-2000-000630.jpg?width=300" alt="Saturn V"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn-Shuttle">Saturn-Shuttle</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Canceled</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Kennedy Space Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Saturn-Shuttle was a preliminary concept of launching the Space Shuttle orbiter using a modified version of the first stage of the Saturn V rocket.

Four orbital and three suborbital launches were made, with four of the launches resulting in failures. The Scout X-1 was similar to the Scout X test vehicle which was launched in April 1960, however it had live second and fourth stages, as opposed to the battleship versions used on the Scout X. It also featured an improved first stage, using an instead of the earlier used on the Scout X. All seven launches occurred from Launch Area 3 at the Wallops Flight Facility. The maiden flight was a suborbital test of the rocket's systems, and was conducted successfully on 2 July 1960, with the rocket launching at 00:04 GMT. Following this, a suborbital radiation experiment was successfully launched on 4 October 1960. The first orbital launch attempt, with the S-56 satellite, was made on 4 December 1960, and ended in failure after the second stage malfunctioned. On 16 February 1961, a Scout X-1 successfully placed Explorer 9, a reflight of the failed S-56, into Earth orbit, in the first successful orbital launch to be conducted by a Scout rocket. The next launch attempt on 30 June 1961 carried the S-55 satellite, but this did not reach orbit because the third stage failed to ignite. A reflight of S-55, Explorer 13, was launched on 25 August 1961, but reached a lower than planned orbit, and was unusable. The final flight of the Scout X-1 was made on 19 October 1961, carrying plasma and aeronomy research payloads on a suborbital trajectory. This launch was successful. Several derivatives of the Scout X-1 were also flown. The United States Navy developed the Blue Scout, which was a three-stage sounding rocket, and the Blue Scout II which was almost identical to the Scout X-1. The Scout X-1A, a five-stage variant of the Scout X-1, was used for a single suborbital launch in March 1962. It featured an improved first stage, and a upper stage.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Scout_X-1_with_Explorer_9_Feb_16_1961.jpg?width=300" alt="Scout X-1"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Dragon_(rocket)">Sea Dragon (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 18143.0</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 23.0</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 150.0</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> </div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Sea Dragon was a 1962 conceptualized design study for a two-stage sea-launched orbital super heavy-lift launch vehicle.

It was first launched on 19 September 1988 (carrying an Ofek-1 satellite payload), making Israel the eighth nation to have an orbital launch capability after the USSR, United States, France, Japan, People's Republic of China, United Kingdom, and India. The Shavit 2 project is believed to have been an offshoot development, resulting from Israel's Jericho nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program. Shavit rockets are launched from Palmachim Airbase by the Israel Space Agency into highly retrograde orbits over the Mediterranean Sea to prevent debris coming down in populated areas and also to avoid flying over nations hostile to Israel to the east; this results in a lower payload-to-orbit than east-directed launches would allow. The launcher consists of three stages powered by solid-fuel rocket motors, with an optional liquid-fuel fourth stage, and is manufactured by Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI). The Republic of South Africa produced and tested a licensed version in cooperation with Israel called the RSA-3 in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to produce a domestic satellite launch vehicle and ballistic missile; the South African program was closed in 1994. An earlier unrelated project called Shavit 2 was the first Israeli sounding rocket, launched on 5 July 1961 for meteorological research. Shavit Three, with an altitude reported as 100 miles (160 km), was launched on 11 August 1961.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Shavit_Ofek7a.jpg?width=300" alt="Shavit 2"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shtil'">Shtil'</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 39.3</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 1.9</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 14.8</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 0</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2015-12-22</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1971-11-05</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Russian submarine Ekaterinburg (K-84), Russian submarine Novomoskovsk (K-407)</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Space launch vehicle Shtil' (Russian: Штиль - calm (weather)), is a converted SLBM used for launching artificial satellites into orbit.

It was operational between 1957 and 2005. Development of the Skylark begun during the early 1950s at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), which approached the Royal Society with an offer for it to carry scientific experiments. During early 1955, the British government agreed to provide £100,000 to support the programme's operations for four years. Development of the Skylark, initially known as the CTV.5 Series 3, was pursued at a rapid pace, with hopes that initial launches could take place during the latter half of 1956. On 7 April 1956, the existence of the Skylark rocket was publicly revealed under the early name of Gassiot vehicle. Launch facilities were established at the existing Woomera missile range in Australia; the Skylarks were produced in Britain and flown to Australia for final assembly, testing, and launching. The Skylark was first launched on 13 February 1957; the first scientific mission occurred during April 1958, quickly becoming regarded as a valuable platform for various fields of research. The vast majority of launches would be performed from Woomera, although other launch sites would later be used at sites across Europe and South America. The British government opted to terminate its support of the programme in 1977, with responsibility for Skylark being turned over to British Aerospace. It continued to be operated for decades more. The 441st and final launch of the Skylark took place from Esrange, Sweden, on 2 May 2005. Launches had been carried out from various purposes, with some military missions being flown, users extended far beyond the UK to include NASA, the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), and German and Swedish space organizations.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Skylark_launch.jpg?width=300" alt="Skylark (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Satellite_Launch_Vehicle">Small Satellite Launch Vehicle</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2022-08-07</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Active</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Satish Dhawan Space Centre</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) is a small-lift launch vehicle developed by ISRO with payload capacity to deliver 500 kg (1,100 lb) to low Earth orbit (500 km (310 mi)) or 300 kg (660 lb) to Sun-synchronous orbit (500 km (310 mi)) for launching small satellites, with the capability to support multiple orbital drop-offs.

It was commissioned to launch Soyuz spacecraft as part of the Soviet human spaceflight program, first with 8 uncrewed test flights, followed by the first 19 crewed launches. The original Soyuz also propelled four test flights of the improved Soyuz 7K-T capsule between 1972 and 1974. In total it flew 30 successful missions over 10 years and suffered two failures. The Soyuz 11A511 type, a member of the R-7 family of rockets, first flew in 1966. Derived from the Voskhod 11A57 type, It was a two-stage rocket, with four liquid-fuelled strap-on boosters clustered around the first stage, with a Block I second stage. The first four test launches were all failures, but eventually it worked. The new, uprated core stage and strap-ons became standard for all R-7 derived launch vehicles to replace the numerous older variants in use on the 8A92, 11A57, and 8K78M types. While the original Blok I stage as developed in 1960 used RD-107 engines, the Soyuz boosters instead had RD-110s, which were more powerful as necessitated by the heavier weight of the Soyuz craft and also had several design improvements to increase reliability and safety on crewed missions. The Molniya 8K78M booster also adopted the RD-110 during 1965, but Voskhod boosters continued using the older RD-107. Starting in 1973, the original Soyuz rocket was gradually superseded by the Soyuz-U derivative type, which became the world's most prolific launcher, flying hundreds of missions over 43 years until its retirement scheduled for 2016. Other direct variants were Soyuz-L for low Earth orbit tests of the LK lunar lander (3 flights) and Soyuz-M built for a quickly abandoned military spacecraft and used for reconnaissance satellites instead (8 flights). The aborted Soyuz 18-1 launch in 1975 was the final crewed flight of the 11A511 and as it occurred shortly before the ASTP mission, the United States requested that the Soviets provide details about this failure. They stated that Soyuz 19 would be using the newer 11A5511U booster model (i.e. Soyuz-U) so that the Soyuz 18-1 malfunction had no bearing on it. Soyuz rockets were assembled horizontally in the at the launch site. The rocket was then rolled out, and erected on the launch pad.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Expedition_51_Rollout_(NHQ201704170027).jpg?width=300" alt="Soyuz (rocket)"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_at_the_Guiana_Space_Centre">Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 0</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2011-10-21</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2022-02-10</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Suspended</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Guiana Space Centre</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre (also known as Soyuz at CSG or Arianespace Soyuz) was a European Space Agency (ESA) programme for operating Soyuz-ST launch vehicles from Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG), providing medium-size launch capability for Arianespace to complement the light Vega and heavy-lift Ariane 5.

In its basic form, it is a three-stage launch vehicle for placing payloads into low Earth orbit. Compared to the previous versions of the Soyuz, the first-stage boosters and two core stages feature uprated engines with improved injection systems. Digital flight control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to be launched from a fixed launch platform, whereas the launch platforms for earlier Soyuz rockets had to be rotated as the rocket could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight. Soyuz-2 is often flown with an upper stage, which allows it to lift payloads into higher orbits, such as Molniya and geosynchronous orbits. The upper stage is equipped with independent flight control and telemetry systems from those used in the rest of the rocket. The NPO Lavochkin manufactured Fregat is the most commonly used upper stage. Soyuz-2 rockets were first launched from Site 31 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, and Site 43 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, launch facilities shared with earlier R-7 derived rockets including the Soyuz-U and Molniya. Commercial Soyuz-2 flights are contracted by Starsem and have launched from Site 31 at Baikonur Cosmodrome and Ensemble de Lancement Soyouz (ELS), which has been built at the Centre Spatial Guyanais on the northern coast of South America. The Soyuz-2 can deliver 3,250 kg (7,170 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) from this equatorial site. In 2016, the new Vostochny Cosmodrome started operating Soyuz-2 flights as well, from its first launch pad called Vostochny Cosmodrome Site 1S. The Soyuz-2 has replaced the Molniya-M, Soyuz-U and Soyuz-FG since 2010, 2017 and 2019 respectively. TsSKB-Progress halted production of Soyuz-U in April 2015; the final flight of a Soyuz-U rocket took place on 22 February 2017, carrying Progress MS-05 to the International Space Station (ISS). According to CNES officials interviewed in May 2018, launches of Soyuz from Centre Spatial Guyanais may be replaced by the Ariane 6 medium-lift version A62 in 2021, but later moved back to 2022 or later.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Soyuz_2_metop.jpg?width=300" alt="Soyuz-2"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz-FG">Soyuz-FG</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 2.95</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2002-08-21</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2011-07-21</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Baikonur Cosmodrome, Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 31</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Soyuz-FG launch vehicle was an improved version of the Soyuz-U from the R-7 family of rockets, designed and constructed by TsSKB-Progress in Samara, Russia.

Soyuz-FG made its maiden flight on 20 May 2001, carrying a Progress cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS). It was retired after the 25 September 2019 launch of Soyuz MS-15 to the ISS; the analog control system significantly limited its capabilities and prompted its replacement by Soyuz-2. From 30 October 2002 to 25 September 2019, the Soyuz-FG was the only vehicle used by the Russian Federal Space Agency to launch Soyuz-TMA and Soyuz-MS crewed spacecraft to the ISS. For uncrewed flights, Soyuz-FG optionally flew with a Fregat upper stage, developed and produced by Lavochkin Association in Khimki. The maiden flight of this configuration occurred on 2 June 2003, the first of ten such launches. Launches of the Soyuz-FG/Fregat configuration were marketed by a European-Russian company called Starsem. Soyuz-FG was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, from Gagarin's Start (pad LC-1/5) for crewed missions, and from LC-31/6 for satellite launches with the Fregat variant. The Soyuz-FG performed 64 successful launches until its first failure on 11 October 2018 with the Soyuz MS-10 mission. A video recording of the spaceflight released several weeks later suggested a faulty sensor, resulted in the destruction of the rocket. The crew, NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin, escaped safely.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Soyuz_TMA-3_launch.jpg?width=300" alt="Soyuz-FG"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz-U">Soyuz-U</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 22</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1973-05-18</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2017-02-22</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Baikonur Cosmodrome, Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Plesetsk Cosmodrome Site 41</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Soyuz-U launch vehicle was an improved version of the original Soyuz rocket. Soyuz-U was part of the R-7 family of rockets based on the R-7 Semyorka missile. Members of this rocket family were designed by the TsSKB design bureau and constructed at the Progress factory in Samara, Russia (now a united company, TsSKB-Progress). The first Soyuz-U flight took place on 18 May 1973, carrying as its payload Kosmos 559, a Zenit military surveillance satellite. The final flight of a Soyuz-U rocket took place on 22 February 2017, carrying Progress MS-05 to the International Space Station. Soyuz-U was in use continuously for almost 44 years. Production of R-7 derived launch vehicles peaked in the late 1970s-early 1980s at 55–60 a year. Soyuz-U held the world record of highest launch rate in a year in 1979 with 47 flights until this was beaten by SpaceX's Falcon 9 in 2022. Over its operational lifetime, the Soyuz-U variant flew a total of 786 missions, another world record. Soyuz-U has also been one of the most reliable launchers, with a success rate of 97.3%. The rocket had a streak of 112 consecutive successful launches between 11 July 1990 and 5 May 1996.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Soyuz_18_booster.jpg?width=300" alt="Soyuz-U"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System">Space Launch System</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> Over US$2 billion excluding development</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2022-11-16</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> </div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Kennedy Space Center, Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Space Launch System (SLS) is an American super heavy-lift expendable launch vehicle developed by NASA. As of 2022, SLS has the highest payload capacity of any rocket in operational service, as well as the greatest liftoff thrust of any rocket in operation. As the primary launch vehicle of the Artemis moon landing program, SLS is designed to launch the crewed Orion spacecraft on a trans-lunar trajectory. The first uncrewed launch, Artemis 1, took place on 16 November 2022. Development of SLS began in 2011, as a replacement for the retired Space Shuttle as well as the cancelled Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles. As a Shuttle-derived vehicle, the Space Launch System reuses hardware from the Space Shuttle program, including the solid rocket boosters, RS-25 first stage engines, and various tooling used to construct the vehicle. An original flight date of late 2016 was delayed by nearly 6 years. The SLS program has attracted criticism for such delays, high cost, and its non-competitive nature in the use of Space Shuttle components and contractors. All Space Launch System flights are launched from LC-39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The first three SLS flights use the Block 1 configuration, consisting of reused Space Shuttle boosters and the ICPS upper stage. An improved Block 1B configuration, with the EUS upper stage, is planned to debut on the fourth flight; a further improved Block 2 configuration featuring new solid rocket boosters is planned to debut on the ninth flight. After the first four flights, NASA plans to transfer production and launch operations of SLS to Deep Space Transport LLC, a joint venture between Boeing and Northrop Grumman.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/NASA_Artemis_1_Launch.jpg?width=300" alt="Space Launch System"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> 4.5E8</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1981-04-12</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2011-07-21</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> </div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Space Shuttle is a retired, partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space Shuttle program. Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft where it was the only item funded for development. The first (STS-1) of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights (STS-5) beginning in 1982. Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011. They launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), conducted science experiments in orbit, participated in the Shuttle-Mir program with Russia, and participated in construction and servicing of the International Space Station (ISS). The Space Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1,323 days. Space Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines, a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters (SRBs), and the expendable external tank (ET) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Space Shuttle was launched vertically, like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the orbiter's three main engines, which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, while the main engines continued to operate, and the ET was jettisoned after main engine cutoff and just before orbit insertion, which used the orbiter's two Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere. The orbiter was protected during reentry by its thermal protection system tiles, and it glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing, usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC, Florida, or to Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base, California. If the landing occurred at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC atop the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), a specially modified Boeing 747. The first orbiter, Enterprise, was built in 1976 and used in Approach and Landing Tests (ALT), but had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, and Atlantis. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003, with a total of 14 astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, Endeavour, was built in 1991 to replace Challenger. The three surviving operational vehicles were retired from service following Atlantis's final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. relied on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to the ISS from the last Shuttle flight until the launch of the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission in May 2020.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/STS120LaunchHiRes-edit1.jpg?width=300" alt="Space Shuttle"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship">SpaceX Starship</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> </div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Starship is a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle being developed by American aerospace company SpaceX. If successful, Starship will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever built and is expected to be the first to demonstrate total reusability. The Starship system consists of the Super Heavy first-stage booster and the Starship second stage, which serves as a self-contained spacecraft while in orbit. Both stages are powered by Raptor engines, which burn liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas propellants in a highly efficient full-flow staged combustion power cycle. Both rocket stages are designed for rapid reuse by landing vertically. The Super Heavy booster can perform a boostback burn and Starship can reenter the atmosphere for a belly-first descent. Starship has a payload capacity of 100 t (220,000 lb) to low Earth orbit in its fully reusable configuration, and is designed for a high flight rate in order to dramatically reduce the cost of space access. Expected applications include satellite launch, including the deployment of a large portion of SpaceX's next-generation Starlink internet constellation; human spaceflight such as space station crew transport, space tourism, and transport of passengers to Mars; and point-to-point suborbital spaceflight. Once in orbit, the Starship spacecraft can additionally be refueled by Starship propellant tankers before transiting to higher energy destinations such as the Moon and Mars. Conceptual designs of a heavy-lift launch vehicle began at SpaceX as early as 2005, with methane fuel being specified in 2012 and the vehicle's stainless steel primary structure in 2019. Starship's development program adopted an iterative and incremental methodology, meaning frequent prototype construction, testing, and refinement. Notable milestones in the program include the first flight of a methane rocket engine (Raptor) in 2019 and demonstration of the belly-flop maneuver in early 2021. Starship's full-scale orbital test flight is expected to take place in late 2022. As of November 2022, Starship is planned to serve four crewed missions and several cargo missions.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Starship_full_stack.jpg?width=300" alt="SpaceX Starship"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_development">SpaceX Starship development</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Developed into the BFR</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Kennedy Space Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">SpaceX Starship development began in 2012, when Elon Musk, CEO of American aerospace company SpaceX, first publicly described a high-level plan to build a reusable rocket system with substantially greater capabilities than the Falcon 9 and the (then- planned) Falcon Heavy.

The final launch on July 15, 1980 (UTC) of a DMSP 5D satellite failed. Thor boosters launched from SLC-10W used an erector system to hoist them up to the pad. While common on Soviet launch vehicles, this method was unusual in the US space program. Thor 304 had been erected on the pad a few weeks before launch, and during this step, a connecting pin in the erector broke and sent the rocket falling back down to ground level. Launch crews examined the Thor for damage, but could not find any outward indication of it. The booster passed routine preflight systems checks and liftoff took place at 6:22 PM PST on July 14, 1980. Shortly after liftoff, the Thor's telemetry system failed, but weather conditions and visibility were excellent, and the booster could be tracked visually for over two minutes. Telemetry from the DMSP satellite indicated that it was operating properly. SECO took place on time, as did the second stage burn. Third stage burn began, and then after about four seconds, all telemetry abruptly ceased. The initial assumption was that the third stage exploded, and initial Air Force press releases about the launch stated such. However, radar tracking showed that the third stage motor continued operating as it drove the DMSP into the Pacific Ocean. The investigation board concluded that connectors in the electrical interface between the second and third stage had been jolted loose by the erector mishap several weeks earlier. After second stage burnout, staging failed to take place due to the misaligned connectors, and the third stage motor thus fired with the spent second stage still attached to it. The force from the third stage motor burning managed to tear the second stage free, but in doing so, it ripped out wiring in the base of the third stage, which shorted out the guidance computer and caused it to direct the stage and spacecraft down into the ocean. Much like the DMSP failure in 1976, the incident was attributed to poor program management.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Thor_DSV-2U_launch_with_DMSP-5D-F5_satellite.jpg?width=300" alt="Thor DSV-2U"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor-Able">Thor-Able</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 51.608</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 2.44</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 26.9</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2020-05-25</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2011-07-21</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Thor-Able was an American expendable launch system and sounding rocket used for a series of re-entry vehicle tests and satellite launches between 1958 and 1960.

It was a member of the Thor family of rockets, and was derived from the Thor-Able. The Ablestar second stage was an enlarged version of the Able, which gave the Thor-Ablestar a greater payload capacity compared to the Thor-Able. It also incorporated restart capabilities, allowing a multiple-burn trajectory to be flown, further increasing payload, or allowing the rocket to reach different orbits. It was the first rocket to be developed with such a capability and development of the stage took a mere eight months. Nineteen Thor-Ablestar were launched between 1960–1965, of which four failed, and a fifth resulted in a partial failure, as only one of two payloads separated from the upper stage. The first failure was the launch of Courier 1A, an experimental communications satellite, on 19 August 1960 when the first stage shut down 30 seconds earlier than planned and was destroyed by the Range Safety officer. On 30 November, another launch involving a Transit satellite failed in practically identical fashion. This episode nearly created an international incident as parts of the Thor landed in Cuba. War was threatened. Cuban leader Fidel Castro subsequently sold off the Thor's engine to the Soviets and the Chinese received its thrust vectors, which ended up proving valuable to the latter's development of a ballistic missile capability. To prevent this from happening again, future Thor Ablestar launches had their flight paths modified to avoid passing over Cuba. The launch of a Transit satellite on 22 February 1961 was successful, but its companion Lofti satellite failed to separate from the second stage. On 29 June 1961, a Thor-Ablestar successfully inserted a Transit-4A into orbit, but two hours later the Ablestar exploded for unknown reasons into hundreds of pieces, which remained in orbit. The third launch failure occurred on 24 January 1962 when the second stage produced insufficient thrust to achieve orbital velocity for several piggybacked satellites. The fourth and final failure was the launch of an Anna geodetic satellite on 10 May 1962 when the second stage completely failed to ignite. Two versions were built; the Thor-Ablestar 1, with a DM-21 Thor, and an AJ-10-104 second stage engine, and the Thor-Ablestar 2, which had a DSV-2A Thor first stage, and an uprated AJ-10-104D engine on the second stage. Thor-Ablestar 1 launches occurred from LC-17 at Cape Canaveral, and Thor-Ablestar 2 rockets were launched from LC-75-1 at Vandenberg Space Force Base and is now designated SLC-2.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Thor_Able_Star_with_Transit_VBN-2_Dec_5_1963.jpg?width=300" alt="Thor-Ablestar"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor-Agena">Thor-Agena</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1959-01-21</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1968-01-17</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Vandenberg Space Force Base</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Thor-Agena was a series of orbital launch vehicles.

The second stage was the Delta, which had been derived from the earlier Able stage. An Altair solid rocket motor was used as a third stage. The basic design of the original Vanguard upper stages, featuring a pressure-fed nitric acid/UDMH, regeneratively cooled engine, was kept in place, but with an improved AJ10-118 engine. More significantly, the Delta stage featured cold gas attitude control jets allowing it to be stabilized in orbit for restart and more precise burns. The Thor-Delta was the first rocket to use the combination of a Thor missile and a Delta upper stage. This configuration was reused for many later rockets, and a derivative, the Delta II, remained in service until 2018. The Thor-Delta launched a number of significant payloads, including the first communications satellite, Echo 1A; the first British satellite, Ariel 1; and the first active direct-relay communications satellite, Telstar 1.

The first stage of the rocket was a stretched Thor variant named "Long Tank Thrust Augmented Thor". The Long Tank Thor first stage was later adopted by NASA's Delta program for its "Thrust Augmented Improved Delta", which first flew in 1968. The second stage was the Agena-D, which had already been used in conjunction with the standard configuration Thor, as the Thor-Agena. Three Castor rockets would be used as boosters. Most launches carried Corona (KeyHole) reconnaissance satellites, particularly spacecraft of the KH-4 series, however some scientific and technology development satellites were also flown, mostly towards the end of the program. 43 launches took place from 1966-72 with two complete failures and one partial. The launch of a KH-4A photoreconnaissance satellite on May 9, 1967, malfunctioned when the Thor's first stage failed to cut off on schedule and continued burning until LOX depletion, thus putting the satellite into an incorrect orbit that seriously reduced its image quality. The first total failure was the launch of a Nimbus weather satellite on May 5, 1968, when control of the Thor failed during launch and it was destroyed by Range Safety action at T+120 seconds. This mission was noteworthy because the satellite carried a pair of isotopic power generators known as SNAP (Systems For Nuclear Auxiliary Power). As the possibility of a launch failure had been considered during their design, the power generators were equipped with a very sturdy casing to prevent their radioactive contents from escaping into the environment. After the destruction of Nimbus-B's launch vehicle, Navy crews began an extensive search for the SNAP generators. On September 27, the Nimbus satellite was located in 300 feet of water near the Santa Barbara Islands with the SNAP units nearby. They were successfully fished out of the ocean two weeks later and their protective casings found to be intact. The fuel inside them was taken out and reused in a subsequent Nimbus launch. As part of the investigation, parts of the Thor were recovered and examined. It was discovered that the yaw gyro was installed improperly and had missing alignment pins, apparently because a pad technician had mistakenly broken them off during installation. Without the pins, the gyro rotated out of position with the effect that the booster lost control almost as soon as the pitch and roll sequence started. The other total failure was the attempted launch of a KH-4B photo-reconnaissance satellite on February 17, 1971. A technician mistakenly added too much lubricant to the Thor's fuel system, the result being that the excess fluid formed a frozen plug in a section of plumbing. The booster lifted and flew normally until the start of the pitch and roll program about 20 seconds after liftoff at which point the turbopump gearbox disintegrated due to loss of lubricant. Flying debris tore up the Thor's thrust section, causing total loss of thrust. With the main engine being the only source of attitude control, the launch vehicle tumbled uncontrollably and exploded 30 seconds after launch, the debris impacting in Bear Creek Canyon a quarter mile from the launch complex. The Thorad-Agena was flown in two different configurations, the SLV-2G, and the SLV-2H. These differed in that the SLV-2G used Castor 1 strap-on boosters, whereas the 2H used Castor 2s.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Thorad_Agena-D_launching_POPPY_satellite.jpg?width=300" alt="Thorad-Agena"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_23G">Titan 23G</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1988-09-05</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2003-10-18</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Vandenberg Air Force Base, Vandenberg Space Launch Complex 4</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Titan 23G, Titan II(23)G, Titan 2(23)G or Titan II SLV was an American expendable launch system derived from the LGM-25C Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile. Retired Titan II missiles were converted by Martin Marietta, into which the Glenn L. Martin Company, which built the original Titan II, had merged. It was used to carry payloads for the United States Air Force (USAF), NASA and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Thirteen were launched from Space Launch Complex 4W (SLC-4W) at the Vandenberg Air Force Base between 1988 and 2003. Titan 23G rockets consisted of two stages burning liquid propellant. The first stage was powered by one Aerojet LR87 engine with two combustion chambers and nozzles, and the second stage was propelled by an LR91. On some flights, the spacecraft included a kick motor, usually the Star-37XFP-ISS; however, the Star-37S was also used. A contract to refurbish fourteen Titan II missiles to the Titan 23G configuration was awarded to Martin Marietta in January 1986. The first launch occurred on 5 September 1988, carrying a classified payload for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office. Thirteen were launched, with the fourteenth going to the Evergreen Aviation Museum. The final flight occurred on 17 October 2003, carrying a Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite. During refurbishment, the forward structure of the second stage was modified with the addition of a payload attachment fitting to attach the payload to the rocket, and installing a payload fairing to protect it during launch. The engines were refurbished, and the rockets' guidance and control systems were upgraded by Delco Electronics. The former Titan IIIB pad at Vandenberg, SLC-4W, was modified to accommodate the Titan 23G, and was used for all thirteen launches.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Titan_23G_rocket.gif?width=300" alt="Titan 23G"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_34D">Titan 34D</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1982-10-30</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1989-09-04</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 40, Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 4, Vandenberg Air Force Base</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Titan 34D was a United States expendable launch vehicle used to launch a number of satellites for military applications.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/DF-SC-83-03173_cropped.jpeg?width=300" alt="Titan 34D"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_II_GLV">Titan II GLV</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 154.224</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 3.048</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 33.2232</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2015-12-22</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2013-03-01</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Cape Canaveral Air Force Station</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Titan II GLV (Gemini Launch Vehicle) or Gemini-Titan II was an American expendable launch system derived from the Titan II missile, which was used to launch twelve Gemini missions for NASA between 1964 and 1966.

It is based on the R-36 intercontinental ballistic missile designed by Mikhail Yangel and made eight launches, with seven successes and one failure. All of its launches were conducted from LC-90 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It is sometimes designated Tsyklon-2A, not to be confused with the later Tsyklon-2 rocket. It was introduced in 1967 and was derived from the R-36 ICBM (NATO designation SS-9 Scarp). It was retired in 1969. It made its maiden flight on 27 October 1967. The booster's design was kept secret and no images or film clips of the complete vehicle were released to the public until after the collapse of the Soviet Union, in part because of being used exclusively for military payloads and also because it was derived from an actively serving missile system. After 1991, the plant where the R-36/Tsyklon were manufactured ended up in newly independent Ukraine. Tsyklon was designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau and manufactured by Yuzhmash (both in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine). Control system was designed at NPO "Electropribor" (Kharkiv, Ukraine). The last flown derivative, the Tsyklon-3 was retired in January 2009. Another derivative, the Tsyklon-4, continued to be developed after the retirement of Tsyklon-3, but the Tsyklon-4 project was cancelled in 2015 due to financial concerns. Tsyklon-4 never reached launch pad.

The goal was to replace the Space Shuttle by developing a re-usable spaceplane that could launch satellites into orbit at a fraction of the cost. While the requirement was for an uncrewed launcher, it was expected to carry passengers as cargo. The VentureStar would have had a wingspan of 68 feet (20.7 m), a length of 127 feet (38.7 m), and would have weighed roughly 1000 t (2.2 million lb). VentureStar was intended to be a commercial single-stage-to-orbit vehicle that would be launched vertically, but return to Earth as an airplane. Flights would have been leased to NASA as needed. After failures with the X-33 subscale technology demonstrator test vehicle, funding was cancelled in 2001. VentureStar was essentially a bigger version of the X-33 but was not produced. The X-33 had ongoing problems meeting performance requirements for the carbonfibre hydrogen fuel tank. There were a number of other technologies that were part of the program, including the linear aerospike rocket engine. One point of praise was the metallic thermal protection system developed by BF Goodrich.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Venturestar1.jpg?width=300" alt="VentureStar"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_(rocket)">Viking (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1949-05-03</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1955-02-04</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> USS Norton Sound (AVM-1), White Sands Missile Range</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Viking was series of twelve sounding rockets designed and built by the Glenn L.

The Blok I stage in the Voskhod booster used the RD-0107 engine rather than the crew rated and more powerful RD-0110 used on the Soyuz. The sole exception to this were the two manned Voskhod launches, which had RD-0108 engines, a crew-rated RD-0107 but with the same performance. All 11A57s launched after 1965 were functionally a 11A511 without the Soyuz's payload shroud and launch escape system (with the exception of the second stage propulsion system as noted above). Around 300 were flown from Baikonur and Plesetsk through 1976 (various payloads, but Zenith IMINT satellites were the most common). The newer 11A511U core had been introduced in 1973, but the existing stock of 11A57s took another three years to use up.

One of the booster engines failed 1.8 seconds after launch, and the rocket came down 300 metres (980 ft) away from the pad. The resulting explosion damaged the launch complex, and necessitated delays to several other launches that had been scheduled from that complex, including Vostok 3 and Vostok 4. Thirteen months later, on 10 July 1963, an almost identical failure occurred. The other three failures were caused by a second stage malfunction, a second stage guidance problem, and a problem with the first stage. The Vostok-2 was used exclusively to launch Zenit-2 reconnaissance satellites. Launches occurred from sites 1/5 and 31/6 at Baikonur, and Site 41/1 at Plesetsk.

Ninety-three were launched, of which one failed. Another was destroyed before launch. It was originally built as a specialised version of the earlier Vostok-2, for injecting lighter payloads into higher sun-synchronous orbits. It was a member of the R-7 family of rockets, and the last Vostok. The Vostok-2M made its maiden flight on 28 August 1964, from Site 31/6 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, successfully placing , a Meteor weather satellite into orbit. Its only launch failure occurred on 1 February 1969, when the launch of a Meteor failed due to an upper stage problem. At 16:01 GMT on 18 March 1980, a Vostok-2M exploded during fueling at Plesetsk Site 43/4, ahead of the launch of a Tselina-D satellite, killing 48 people who were working on the rocket at the time. A filter in a hydrogen peroxide tank of the third stage had accidentally been soldered with lead instead of tin, with the catalytically active lead solder on the filter causing the explosion upon contact hydrogen peroxide. As a consequence, the H2O2 broke down, overheated, and melted the solder, causing pieces to fall into the H2O2 storage tank and cause a runaway chemical reaction. This led to a fire inside the third stage and eventual explosion which resulted in the complete destruction of the launch vehicle and severe pad damage (LC-43 did not host another launch for three years). Vostok-2M launches occurred from Site 31/6 at Baikonur, and Sites 41/1 and 43 at Plesetsk. It is unclear if any were launched from Site 1/5 at Baikonur. The Vostok-2M was retired in 1991, in favour of standardisation on the Soyuz-U and U2 rockets. The final flight was conducted on 29 August, and carried the IRS-1B satellite for the Indian Space Research Organisation.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Vostok_8A92M.svg?width=300" alt="Vostok-2M"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok-K">Vostok-K</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 2</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1960-12-22</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1964-07-10</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Baikonur Cosmodrome, Gagarin's Start</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Vostok-K (Russian: Восток meaning "East"), GRAU index 8K72K was an expendable carrier rocket used by the Soviet Union for thirteen launches between 1960 and 1964, six of which were manned.

The Vostok-K made its maiden flight on 22 December 1960, three weeks after the retirement of the Vostok-L. The third stage engine failed 425 seconds after launch, and the payload, a spacecraft, failed to reach orbit. The spacecraft was recovered after landing, and the two dogs aboard the spacecraft survived the flight. On 12 April 1961, a Vostok-K rocket was used to launch Vostok 1, the first manned spaceflight, which made Yuri Gagarin the first human to fly in space. All six manned missions of the Vostok programme were launched using Vostok-K rockets. The first two Zenit reconnaissance satellites were also launched with the Vostok-K, but it was soon replaced in that capacity with the uprated 8A92 booster. After the conclusion of the Vostok program, there were two remaining 8K72Ks left; these were used to launch four Elektron scientific satellites on 30 January and 10 July 1964.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Vostok_8K72K.svg?width=300" alt="Vostok-K"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vostok-L">Vostok-L</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 1</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 1960-05-15</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 1960-12-01</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Retired</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Baikonur Cosmodrome</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Vostok-L (Russian: Восток meaning "East"), GRAU index 8K72 was a rocket used by the Soviet Union to conduct several early tests of the Vostok spacecraft.

First flown in 1999, it has been launched 36 times, with three failures and one partial failure. It is a member of the Zenit family of rockets, and is built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau. RKK Energia produces the Block DM-SL upper stage, whilst the payload fairing is produced by Boeing. Launches are conducted from the Ocean Odyssey platform anchored on the equator in the Pacific Ocean, at a point with 154°W longitude, about 370 kilometres east of Kiritimati. The Zenit-3SL design began in the late 1980s as the Zenit-3, a proposed replacement for the Proton-K, which would have used a Zenit-2 rocket with a Block D upper stage. This proposal was shelved after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as Russia inherited the space programme, however the Zenit was manufactured in Ukrainian SSR. Boeing became involved in the programme in 1994. The design was subsequently modified, with a modified version of the Block DM replacing the Block D. Sea Launch integrates the rockets in California, and transfers them to Odyssey via the Sea Launch Commander for transportation to the launch site. Once at the launch site, the rocket is erected on the platform, and a three-day countdown is initiated. The countdown is fully automated, and personnel are evacuated from the launch platform to Commander prior to launch. Zenit-3SL launches predominantly carry communications satellites into geosynchronous transfer orbits. As of 2009, the only payload to be launched by a Zenit-3SL that was not a communications satellite was a DemoSat, on the maiden flight. The only launch to be conducted to an orbit other than GTO was that of , which was intended to be placed into medium Earth orbit, however the rocket failed to reach orbit.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Zenit-3SL.svg?width=300" alt="Zenit-3SL"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenit-3SLB">Zenit-3SLB</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> 471.0</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 3.9</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 59.6</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> 2015-12-22</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> 2013-03-01</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Active</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Baikonur Cosmodrome</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">The Zenit 3SLB or Zenit-3M is a USSR expendable carrier rocket derived from the Zenit-2SB. It is a member of the Zenit family of rockets, which were designed by the Yuzhnoye Design Office. Produced at Yuzhmash, the rocket is a modified version of the Zenit-3SL, designed to be launched from a conventional launch pad rather than the Sea Launch Ocean Odyssey platform. Most of components of the rocket are produced in Russia. Launches of Zenit-3SLB rockets are conducted from Site 45/1 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Commercial launches are conducted by Land Launch, and use the designation 3SLB, whilst launches conducted by Federal Space Agency Roskosmos or the Russian Space Forces will use the designation 3M. It consists of a Zenit 2SB (Zenit-2M) core vehicle, with a Block DM-SLB upper stage by RSC Energia (Russia). The rocket's fairing is developed by Lavochkin (Khimki, Moscow, Russia). The launch services are provided by "Land Launch", a subsidiary of Sea Launch, and Space International Services, a Russian/Ukrainian joint venture. The first launch of a Zenit-3SLB occurred on 28 April 2008, carrying the Israeli AMOS-3 satellite. This was also the first commercial Zenit launch from Baikonur since a failed Globalstar launch in 1998, and the first launch to be conducted by the Land Launch consortium.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Zenit-3SLБ.jpg?width=300" alt="Zenit-3SLB"></div></div><div class="rocket-box"><div class="left-section"><h2><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuljanah_(rocket)">Zuljanah (rocket)</a></h2><div><div><strong>Launch Cost:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Mass (tons):</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Diameter (m):</strong> 1.5</div><div><strong>Height (m):</strong> 25.5</div><div><strong>Stages:</strong> 3</div><div><strong>Launch Failures:</strong> 0</div><div><strong>Maiden Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Final Flight:</strong> No information</div><div><strong>Service Status:</strong> Under Development</div><div><strong>Launch Sites:</strong> Semnan Space Center</div></div></div><div class="middle-section"><h3>Description</h3><div class="description-text">Zuljanah (Persian: ماهواره‌بر ذوالجناح), also spelled Zoljanah (and with a host of other spellings appearing sporadically), is an Iranian Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV), made by the Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (Iran), which was unveiled on 1 February 2021, and was launched (at an unknown time before 1 February 2021, possibly 31 January 2021) into sub-orbital flight (apogee 500km) for testing and telemetry purposes. Zuljanah is able to carry satellites weighing up to 220kg into an orbit 500 kilometers above the Earth. According to Seyed Ahmad Husseini, the space spokesman of the Ministry of Defense : The Zuljanah SLV is part of a larger project called "Hazrat Fatemeh Al-Zahra" (Persian: حضرت فاطمه الزهراء). This SLV is considered to be the first indigenously designed and manufactured hybrid fuel satellite launch vehicle (solid/liquid fuel). As of June 2022, two more test flights are planned.</div></div><div class="right-section"><img src="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/ماهواره‌بر_ذوالجناح.jpg?width=300" alt="Zuljanah (rocket)"></div></div>
